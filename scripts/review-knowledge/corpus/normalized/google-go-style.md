Overview | Guide | Decisions | Best practices

The Go Style Guide and accompanying documents codify the current best approaches for writing readable and idiomatic Go. Adherence to the Style Guide is not intended to be absolute, and these documents will never be exhaustive. Our intention is to minimize the guesswork of writing readable Go so that newcomers to the language can avoid common mistakes. The Style Guide also serves to unify the style guidance given by anyone reviewing Go code at Google.

The **Style Guide** outlines
the foundation of Go style at Google. This document is definitive and is
used as the basis for the recommendations in Style Decisions and Best
Practices.

**Style Decisions** is a
more verbose document that summarizes decisions on specific style points and
discusses the reasoning behind the decisions where appropriate.

These decisions may occasionally change based on new data, new language features, new libraries, or emerging patterns, but it is not expected that individual Go programmers at Google should keep up-to-date with this document.

**Best Practices**
documents some of the patterns that have evolved over time that solve common
problems, read well, and are robust to code maintenance needs.

These best practices are not canonical, but Go programmers at Google are encouraged to use them where possible to keep the codebase uniform and consistent.

These documents intend to:

These documents do **not** intend to:

There will always be differences from one Go programmer to another and from one team’s codebase to another. However, it is in the best interest of Google and Alphabet that our codebase be as consistent as possible. (See guide for more on consistency.) To that end, feel free to make style improvements as you see fit, but you do not need to nit-pick every violation of the Style Guide that you find. In particular, these documents may change over time, and that is no reason to cause extra churn in existing codebases; it suffices to write new code using the latest best practices and address nearby issues over time.

It is important to recognize that issues of style are inherently personal and
that there are always inherent trade-offs. Much of the guidance in these
documents is subjective, but just like with `gofmt`, there is significant value
in the uniformity they provide. As such, style recommendations will not be
changed without due discourse, Go programmers at Google are encouraged to follow
the style guide even where they might disagree.

The following words, which are used throughout the style documents, are defined below:

**Canonical**: Establishes prescriptive and enduring rules

Within these documents, “canonical” is used to describe something that is considered a standard that all code (old and new) should follow and that is not expected to change substantially over time. Principles in the canonical documents should be understood by authors and reviewers alike, so everything included within a canonical document must meet a high bar. As such, canonical documents are generally shorter and prescribe fewer elements of style than non-canonical documents.

https://google.github.io/styleguide/go#canonical

**Normative**: Intended to establish consistency

Within these documents, “normative” is used to describe something that is an agreed-upon element of style for use by Go code reviewers, in order that the suggestions, terminology, and justifications are consistent. These elements may change over time, and these documents will reflect such changes so that reviewers can remain consistent and up-to-date. Authors of Go code are not expected to be familiar with the normative documents, but the documents will frequently be used as a reference by reviewers in readability reviews.

https://google.github.io/styleguide/go#normative

**Idiomatic**: Common and familiar

Within these documents, “idiomatic” is used to refer to something that is prevalent in Go code and has become a familiar pattern that is easy to recognize. In general, an idiomatic pattern should be preferred to something unidiomatic if both serve the same purpose in context, as this is what will be the most familiar to readers.

This guide assumes the reader is familiar with Effective Go, as it provides a common baseline for Go code across the entire Go community.

at Google. This document is **normative and

information.

There are a few overarching principles that summarize how to think about writing readable Go code. The following are attributes of readable code, in order of importance:

The core goal of readability is to produce code that is clear to the reader.

Clarity is primarily achieved with effective naming, helpful commentary, and efficient code organization.

Clarity is to be viewed through the lens of the reader, not the author of the code. It is more important that code be easy to read than easy to write. Clarity in code has two distinct facets:

Go is designed such that it should be relatively straightforward to see what the code is doing. In cases of uncertainty or where a reader may require prior knowledge in order to understand the code, it is worth investing time in order to make the code’s purpose clearer for future readers. For example, it may help to:

There is no one-size-fits-all approach here, but it is important to prioritize clarity when developing Go code.

The code’s rationale is often sufficiently communicated by the names of variables, functions, methods, or packages. Where it is not, it is important to add commentary. The “Why?” is especially important when the code contains nuances that a reader may not be familiar with, such as:

An API might require care to use correctly. For example, a piece of code may be intricate and difficult to follow for performance reasons, or a complex sequence of mathematical operations may use type conversions in an unexpected way. In these cases and many more, it is important that accompanying commentary and documentation explain these aspects so that future maintainers don’t make a mistake and so that readers can understand the code without needing to reverse-engineer it.

It is also important to be aware that some attempts to provide clarity (such as adding extra commentary) can actually obscure the code’s purpose by adding clutter, restating what the code already says, contradicting the code, or adding maintenance burden to keep the comments up-to-date. Allow the code to speak for itself (e.g., by making the symbol names themselves self-describing) rather than adding redundant comments. It is often better for comments to explain why something is done, not what the code is doing.

The Google codebase is largely uniform and consistent. It is often the case that code that stands out (e.g., by using an unfamiliar pattern) is doing so for a good reason, typically for performance. Maintaining this property is important to make it clear to readers where they should focus their attention when reading a new piece of code.

The standard library contains many examples of this principle in action. Among them:

`package sort`.`strings.Cut` is only four lines of code,
but they improve the
clarity and correctness of callsites.Your Go code should be simple for those using, reading, and maintaining it.

Go code should be written in the simplest way that accomplishes its goals, both in terms of behavior and performance. Within the Google Go codebase, simple code:

Tradeoffs can arise between code simplicity and API usage simplicity. For example, it may be worthwhile to have the code be more complex so that the end user of the API may more easily call the API correctly. In contrast, it may also be worthwhile to leave a bit of extra work to the end user of the API so that the code remains simple and easy to understand.

When code needs complexity, the complexity should be added deliberately. This is typically necessary if additional performance is required or where there are multiple disparate customers of a particular library or service. Complexity may be justified, but it should come with accompanying documentation so that clients and future maintainers are able to understand and navigate the complexity. This should be supplemented with tests and examples that demonstrate its correct usage, especially if there is both a “simple” and a “complex” way to use the code.

This principle does not imply that complex code cannot or should not be written in Go or that Go code is not allowed to be complex. We strive for a codebase that avoids unnecessary complexity so that when complexity does appear, it indicates that the code in question requires care to understand and maintain. Ideally, there should be accompanying commentary that explains the rationale and identifies the care that should be taken. This often arises when optimizing code for performance; doing so often requires a more complex approach, like preallocating a buffer and reusing it throughout a goroutine lifetime. When a maintainer sees this, it should be a clue that the code in question is performance-critical, and that should influence the care that is taken when making future changes. If employed unnecessarily, on the other hand, this complexity is a burden on those who need to read or change the code in the future.

If code turns out to be very complex when its purpose should be simple, this is often a signal to revisit the implementation to see if there is a simpler way to accomplish the same thing.

Where there are several ways to express the same idea, prefer the one that uses the most standard tools. Sophisticated machinery often exists, but should not be employed without reason. It is easy to add complexity to code as needed, whereas it is much harder to remove existing complexity after it has been found to be unnecessary.

As an example, consider production code that contains a flag bound to a variable
with a default value which must be overridden in tests. Unless intending to test
the program’s command-line interface itself (say, with `os/exec`), it is simpler
and therefore preferable to override the bound value directly rather than by
using `flag.Set`.

Similarly, if a piece of code requires a set membership check, a boolean-valued
map (e.g., `map[string]bool`) often suffices. Libraries that provide set-like
types and functionality should only be used if more complicated operations are
required that are impossible or overly complicated with a map.

Concise Go code has a high signal-to-noise ratio. It is easy to discern the relevant details, and the naming and structure guide the reader through these details.

There are many things that can get in the way of surfacing the most salient details at any given time:

Repetitive code especially obscures the differences between each nearly-identical section, and requires a reader to visually compare similar lines of code to find the changes. Table-driven testing is a good example of a mechanism that can concisely factor out the common code from the important details of each repetition, but the choice of which pieces to include in the table will have an impact on how easy the table is to understand.

When considering multiple ways to structure code, it is worth considering which way makes important details the most apparent.

Understanding and using common code constructions and idioms are also important for maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio. For example, the following code block is very common in error handling, and the reader can quickly understand the purpose of this block.

```
// Good:
if err := doSomething(); err != nil {
 // ...
}
```
If code looks very similar to this but is subtly different, a reader may not notice the change. In cases like this, it is worth intentionally “boosting” the signal of the error check by adding a comment to call attention to it.

```
// Good:
if err := doSomething(); err == nil { // if NO error
 // ...
}
```
Code is edited many more times than it is written. Readable code not only makes sense to a reader who is trying to understand how it works, but also to the programmer who needs to change it. Clarity is key.

Maintainable code:

When using abstractions like interfaces and types which by definition remove information from the context in which they are used, it is important to ensure that they provide sufficient benefit. Editors and IDEs can connect directly to a method definition and show the corresponding documentation when a concrete type is used, but can only refer to an interface definition otherwise. Interfaces are a powerful tool, but come with a cost, since the maintainer may need to understand the specifics of the underlying implementation in order to correctly use the interface, which must be explained within the interface documentation or at the call-site.

Maintainable code also avoids hiding important details in places that are easy to overlook. For example, in each of the following lines of code, the presence or lack of a single character is critical to understand the line:

```
// Bad:
// The use of = instead of := can change this line completely.
if user, err = db.UserByID(userID); err != nil {
 // ...
}
```
```
// Bad:
// The ! in the middle of this line is very easy to miss.
leap := (year%4 == 0) && (!(year%100 == 0) || (year%400 == 0))
```
Neither of these are incorrect, but both could be written in a more explicit fashion, or could have an accompanying comment that calls attention to the important behavior:

```
// Good:
u, err := db.UserByID(userID)
if err != nil {
 return fmt.Errorf("invalid origin user: %s", err)
}
user = u
```
```
// Good:
// Gregorian leap years aren't just year%4 == 0.
// See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Algorithm.
var (
 leap4 = year%4 == 0
 leap100 = year%100 == 0
 leap400 = year%400 == 0
)
leap := leap4 && (!leap100 || leap400)
```
In the same way, a helper function that hides critical logic or an important edge-case could make it easy for a future change to fail to account for it properly.

Predictable names are another feature of maintainable code. A user of a package or a maintainer of a piece of code should be able to predict the name of a variable, method, or function in a given context. Function parameters and receiver names for identical concepts should typically share the same name, both to keep documentation understandable and to facilitate refactoring code with minimal overhead.

Maintainable code minimizes its dependencies (both implicit and explicit). Depending on fewer packages means fewer lines of code that can affect behavior. Avoiding dependencies on internal or undocumented behavior makes code less likely to impose a maintenance burden when those behaviors change in the future.

When considering how to structure or write code, it is worth taking the time to think through ways in which the code may evolve over time. If a given approach is more conducive to easier and safer future changes, that is often a good trade-off, even if it means a slightly more complicated design.

Consistent code is code that looks, feels, and behaves like similar code throughout the broader codebase, within the context of a team or package, and even within a single file.

Consistency concerns do not override any of the principles above, but if a tie must be broken, it is often beneficial to break it in favor of consistency.

Consistency within a package is often the most immediately important level of consistency. It can be very jarring if the same problem is approached in multiple ways throughout a package, or if the same concept has many names within a file. However, even this should not override documented style principles or global consistency.

These guidelines collect the most important aspects of Go style that all Go code is expected to follow. We expect that these principles be learned and followed by the time readability is granted. These are not expected to change frequently, and new additions will have to clear a high bar.

The guidelines below expand on the recommendations in Effective Go, which provide a common baseline for Go code across the entire community.

All Go source files must conform to the format outputted by the `gofmt` tool.
This format is enforced by a presubmit check in the Google codebase.
Generated code should generally also be formatted (e.g., by using
`format.Source`), as it is also browsable in Code Search.

Go source code uses `MixedCaps` or `mixedCaps` (camel case) rather than
underscores (snake case) when writing multi-word names.

This applies even when it breaks conventions in other languages. For example, a
constant is `MaxLength` (not `MAX_LENGTH`) if exported and `maxLength` (not
`max_length`) if unexported.

Local variables are considered unexported for the purpose of choosing the initial capitalization.

There is no fixed line length for Go source code. If a line feels too long, prefer refactoring instead of splitting it. If it is already as short as it is practical for it to be, the line should be allowed to remain long.

Do not split a line:

Naming is more art than science. In Go, names tend to be somewhat shorter than in many other languages, but the same general guidelines apply. Names should:

You can find more specific guidance on naming in decisions.

Where the style guide has nothing to say about a particular point of style, authors are free to choose the style that they prefer, unless the code in close proximity (usually within the same file or package, but sometimes within a team or project directory) has taken a consistent stance on the issue.

Examples of **valid** local style considerations:

`%s` or `%v` for formatted printing of errorsExamples of **invalid** local style considerations:

If the local style disagrees with the style guide but the readability impact is limited to one file, it will generally be surfaced in a code review for which a consistent fix would be outside the scope of the CL in question. At that point, it is appropriate to file a bug to track the fix.

If a change would worsen an existing style deviation, expose it in more API surfaces, expand the number of files in which the deviation is present, or introduce an actual bug, then local consistency is no longer a valid justification for violating the style guide for new code. In these cases, it is appropriate for the author to clean up the existing codebase in the same CL, perform a refactor in advance of the current CL, or find an alternative that at least does not make the local problem worse.

Overview | Guide | Decisions | Best practices

**Note:** This is part of a series of documents that outline Go Style
at Google. This document is **normative but not
canonical**, and is subordinate to the
core style guide. See the overview for more information.

This document contains style decisions intended to unify and provide standard guidance, explanations, and examples for the advice given by the Go readability mentors.

This document is **not exhaustive** and will grow over time. In cases where
the core style guide contradicts the advice given here, **the style
guide takes precedence**, and this document should be updated accordingly.

See the Overview for the full set of Go Style documents.

The following sections have moved from style decisions to another part of the guide:

**MixedCaps**: see guide#mixed-caps

**Formatting**: see guide#formatting

**Line Length**: see guide#line-length

See the naming section within the core style guide for overarching guidance on naming. The following sections provide further clarification on specific areas within naming.

Names in Go should in general not contain underscores. There are three exceptions to this principle:

`*_test.go` files may
include underscores.`syscall`. This is expected to be very
rare in most codebases.**Note:** Filenames of source code are not Go identifiers and do not have to
follow these conventions. They may contain underscores.

In Go, package names must be concise and use only lowercase letters and numbers
(e.g., `k8s`, `oauth2`). Multi-word package names should remain unbroken and
in all lowercase (e.g., `tabwriter` instead of `tabWriter`, `TabWriter`, or
`tab_writer`).

Avoid selecting package names that are likely to be shadowed by commonly used
local variable names. For example, `usercount` is a better package name than
`count`, since `count` is a commonly used variable name.

Go package names should not have underscores. If you need to import a package that does have one in its name (usually from generated or third party code), it must be renamed at import time to a name that is suitable for use in Go code.

An exception to this is that package names that are only imported by generated code may contain underscores. Specific examples include:

Using the `_test` suffix for unit tests that only exercise the exported API
of a package (package `testing` calls these
“black box tests”). For example, a package
`linkedlist` must define its black box unit tests in a package named
`linkedlist_test` (not `linked_list_test`)

Using underscores and the `_test` suffix for packages that specify
functional or integration tests. For example, a linked list service
integration test could be named `linked_list_service_test`

Using the `_test` suffix for
package-level documentation examples

Avoid uninformative package names like `util`, `utility`, `common`, `helper`,
`model`, `testhelper`, and so on that would tempt users of the package to
rename it when importing. See:

When an imported package is renamed (e.g. ```
import foopb
"path/to/foo_go_proto"
```
), the local name for the package must comply with the
rules above, as the local name dictates how the symbols in the package are
referenced in the file. If a given import is renamed in multiple files,
particularly in the same or nearby packages, the same local name should be used
wherever possible for consistency.

See also: Go blog post about package names.

Receiver variable names must be:

| Long Name | Better Name |
|---|---|
| `func (tray Tray)` | `func (t Tray)` |
| `func (info *ResearchInfo)` | `func (ri *ResearchInfo)` |
| `func (this *ReportWriter)` | `func (w *ReportWriter)` |
| `func (self *Scanner)` | `func (s *Scanner)` |

Constant names must use MixedCaps like all other names in Go. (Exported constants start with uppercase, while unexported constants start with lowercase.) This applies even when it breaks conventions in other languages. Constant names should not be a derivative of their values and should instead explain what the value denotes.

```
// Good:
const MaxPacketSize = 512
const (
 ExecuteBit = 1 << iota
 WriteBit
 ReadBit
)
```
Do not use non-MixedCaps constant names or constants with a `K` prefix.

```
// Bad:
const MAX_PACKET_SIZE = 512
const kMaxBufferSize = 1024
const KMaxUsersPergroup = 500
```
Name constants based on their role, not their values. If a constant does not have a role apart from its value, then it is unnecessary to define it as a constant.

```
// Bad:
const Twelve = 12
const (
 UserNameColumn = "username"
 GroupColumn = "group"
)
```
Words in names that are initialisms or acronyms (e.g., `URL` and `NATO`) should
have the same case. `URL` should appear as `URL` or `url` (as in `urlPony`, or
`URLPony`), never as `Url`. As a general rule, identifiers (e.g., `ID` and `DB`)
should also be capitalized similar to their usage in English prose.

`XMLAPI` because it contains `XML`
and `API`), each letter within a given initialism should have the same case,
but each initialism in the name does not need to have the same case.`DDoS`,
`iOS`, `gRPC`), the initialism should appear as it would in standard prose,
unless you need to change the first letter for the sake of exportedness.
In these cases, the entire initialism should be the same case (e.g. `ddos`,
`IOS`, `GRPC`).| English Usage | Scope | Correct | Incorrect |
|---|---|---|---|
| XML API | Exported | `XMLAPI` | `XmlApi`,`XMLApi`,`XmlAPI`,`XMLapi` |
| XML API | Unexported | `xmlAPI` | `xmlapi`,`xmlApi` |
| iOS | Exported | `IOS` | `Ios`,`IoS` |
| iOS | Unexported | `iOS` | `ios` |
| gRPC | Exported | `GRPC` | `Grpc` |
| gRPC | Unexported | `gRPC` | `grpc` |
| DDoS | Exported | `DDoS` | `DDOS`,`Ddos` |
| DDoS | Unexported | `ddos` | `dDoS`,`dDOS` |
| ID | Exported | `ID` | `Id` |
| ID | Unexported | `id` | `iD` |
| DB | Exported | `DB` | `Db` |
| DB | Unexported | `db` | `dB` |
| Txn | Exported | `Txn` | `TXN` |

Function and method names should not use a `Get` or `get` prefix, unless the
underlying concept uses the word “get” (e.g. an HTTP GET). Prefer starting the
name with the noun directly, for example use `Counts` over `GetCounts`.

If the function involves performing a complex computation or executing a remote
call, a different word like `Compute` or `Fetch` can be used in place of `Get`,
to make it clear to a reader that the function call may take time and could
block or fail.

The general rule of thumb is that the length of a name should be proportional to the size of its scope and inversely proportional to the number of times that it is used within that scope. A variable created at file scope may require multiple words, whereas a variable scoped to a single inner block may be a single word or even just a character or two, to keep the code clear and avoid extraneous information.

Here is a rough baseline. These numeric guidelines are not strict rules. Apply judgement based on context, clarity, and concision.

A name that might be perfectly clear (e.g., `c` for a counter) within a small
scope could be insufficient in a larger scope and would require clarification to
remind the reader of its purpose further along in the code. A scope in which
there are many variables, or variables that represent similar values or
concepts, may necessitate longer variable names than the scope suggests.

The specificity of the concept can also help to keep a variable’s name concise.
For example, assuming there is only a single database in use, a short variable
name like `db` that might normally be reserved for very small scopes may remain
perfectly clear even if the scope is very large. In this case, a single word
`database` is likely acceptable based on the size of the scope, but is not
required as `db` is a very common shortening for the word with few alternate
interpretations.

The name of a local variable should reflect what it contains and how it is being used in the current context, rather than where the value originated. For example, it is often the case that the best local variable name is not the same as the struct or protocol buffer field name.

In general:

`count` or `options` are a good starting point.`userCount` and `projectCount`.`Sandbox` is
preferred over `Sbx`, particularly for exported names.`userCount` is a better name than `numUsers` or
`usersInt`.`users` is a better name than `userSlice`.`ageString` and use `age` for the parsed value.`UserCount` method, a local variable called
`userCount` is probably redundant; `count`, `users`, or even `c` are just as
readable.Single-letter variable names can be a useful tool to minimize repetition, but can also make code needlessly opaque. Limit their use to instances where the full word is obvious and where it would be repetitive for it to appear in place of the single-letter variable.

In general:

`r` for an `io.Reader` or `*http.Request``w` for an `io.Writer` or `http.ResponseWriter``i`) and coordinates (e.g., `x` and `y`).`for _, n := range nodes { ... }`.A piece of Go source code should avoid unnecessary repetition. One common source of this is repetitive names, which often include unnecessary words or repeat their context or type. Code itself can also be unnecessarily repetitive if the same or a similar code segment appears multiple times in close proximity.

Repetitive naming can come in many forms, including:

When naming exported symbols, the name of the package is always visible outside
your package, so redundant information between the two should be reduced or
eliminated. If a package exports only one type and it is named after the package
itself, the canonical name for the constructor is `New` if one is required.

Examples:Repetitive Name -> Better Name

`widget.NewWidget`->`widget.New`
`widget.NewWidgetWithName`->`widget.NewWithName`
`db.LoadFromDatabase`->`db.Load`
`goatteleportutil.CountGoatsTeleported`->`gtutil.CountGoatsTeleported`or`goatteleport.Count`
`myteampb.MyTeamMethodRequest`->`mtpb.MyTeamMethodRequest`or`myteampb.MethodRequest`

The compiler always knows the type of a variable, and in most cases it is also clear to the reader what type a variable is by how it is used. It is only necessary to clarify the type of a variable if its value appears twice in the same scope.

| Repetitive Name | Better Name |
|---|---|
| `var numUsers int` | `var users int` |
| `var nameString string` | `var name string` |
| `var primaryProject *Project` | `var primary *Project` |

If the value appears in multiple forms, this can be clarified either with an
extra word like `raw` and `parsed` or with the underlying representation:

```
// Good:
limitRaw := r.FormValue("limit")
limit, err := strconv.Atoi(limitRaw)
```
```
// Good:
limitStr := r.FormValue("limit")
limit, err := strconv.Atoi(limitStr)
```
Names that include information from their surrounding context often create extra noise without benefit. The package name, method name, type name, function name, import path, and even filename can all provide context that automatically qualifies all names within.

```
// Bad:
// In package "ads/targeting/revenue/reporting"
type AdsTargetingRevenueReport struct{}
func (p *Project) ProjectName() string
```
```
// Good:
// In package "ads/targeting/revenue/reporting"
type Report struct{}
func (p *Project) Name() string
```
```
// Bad:
// In package "sqldb"
type DBConnection struct{}
```
```
// Good:
// In package "sqldb"
type Connection struct{}
```
```
// Bad:
// In package "ads/targeting"
func Process(in *pb.FooProto) *Report {
 adsTargetingID := in.GetAdsTargetingID()
}
```
```
// Good:
// In package "ads/targeting"
func Process(in *pb.FooProto) *Report {
 id := in.GetAdsTargetingID()
}
```
Repetition should generally be evaluated in the context of the user of the symbol, rather than in isolation. For example, the following code has lots of names that may be fine in some circumstances, but redundant in context:

```
// Bad:
func (db *DB) UserCount() (userCount int, err error) {
 var userCountInt64 int64
 if dbLoadError := db.LoadFromDatabase("count(distinct users)", &userCountInt64); dbLoadError != nil {
 return 0, fmt.Errorf("failed to load user count: %s", dbLoadError)
 }
 userCount = int(userCountInt64)
 return userCount, nil
}
```
Instead, information about names that are clear from context or usage can often be omitted:

```
// Good:
func (db *DB) UserCount() (int, error) {
 var count int64
 if err := db.Load("count(distinct users)", &count); err != nil {
 return 0, fmt.Errorf("failed to load user count: %s", err)
 }
 return int(count), nil
}
```
The conventions around commentary (which include what to comment, what style to use, how to provide runnable examples, etc.) are intended to support the experience of reading the documentation of a public API. See Effective Go for more information.

The best practices document’s section on documentation conventions discusses this further.

**Best Practice:** Use doc preview during development and code review to see
whether the documentation and runnable examples are useful and are presented the
way you expect them to be.

**Tip:** Godoc uses very little special formatting; lists and code snippets
should usually be indented to avoid linewrapping. Apart from indentation,
decoration should generally be avoided.

There is no fixed line length for comments in Go.

Long comment lines should be wrapped to ensure that source is readable in tools which do not perform automatic wrapping of comment lines. If you are uncertain where to wrap, 80 or 100 columns are common choices. However, this is not a hard cut-off; there are situations where breaking a long literal text is harmful. There is no requirement for the specific column width at which wrapping occurs. Aim to be consistent within a file.

See this post from The Go Blog on documentation for more on commentary.

```
# Good:
// This is a comment paragraph.
// The length of individual lines doesn't matter in Godoc;
// but the choice of wrapping makes it easy to read on narrow screens.
//
// Don't worry too much about the long URL:
// https://supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.example.com:8080/Animalia/Chordata/Mammalia/Rodentia/Geomyoidea/Geomyidae/
//
// Similarly, if you have other information that is made awkward
// by too many line breaks, use your judgment and include a long line
// if it helps rather than hinders.
```
Avoid comments that fit large amounts of text onto a single line, which is a poor reader experience.

```
# Bad:
// This is a comment paragraph. While some code editors and viewers will wrap the paragraph for the reader, others will display a very long line that will overflow most windows and require users to scroll horizontally. In addition, even on a screen capable of displaying the entire line, it is easier to read a narrower paragraph than very wide one.
//
// Don't worry too much about the long URL:
// https://supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.example.com:8080/Animalia/Chordata/Mammalia/Rodentia/Geomyoidea/Geomyidae/
```
All top-level exported names must have doc comments, as should unexported type or function declarations with unobvious behavior or meaning. These comments should be full sentences that begin with the name of the object being described. An article (“a”, “an”, “the”) can precede the name to make it read more naturally.

```
// Good:
// A Request represents a request to run a command.
type Request struct { ...
// Encode writes the JSON encoding of req to w.
func Encode(w io.Writer, req *Request) { ...
```
Doc comments appear in Godoc and are surfaced by IDEs, and therefore should be written for anyone using the package.

A documentation comment applies to the following symbol, or the group of fields if it appears in a struct.

```
// Good:
// Options configure the group management service.
type Options struct {
 // General setup:
 Name string
 Group *FooGroup
 // Dependencies:
 DB *sql.DB
 // Customization:
 LargeGroupThreshold int // optional; default: 10
 MinimumMembers int // optional; default: 2
}
```
**Best Practice:** If you have doc comments for unexported code, follow the same
custom as if it were exported (namely, starting the comment with the unexported
name). This makes it easy to export it later by simply replacing the unexported
name with the newly-exported one across both comments and code.

Comments that are complete sentences should be capitalized and punctuated like standard English sentences. (As an exception, it is okay to begin a sentence with an uncapitalized identifier name if it is otherwise clear. Such cases are probably best done only at the beginning of a paragraph.)

Comments that are sentence fragments have no such requirements for punctuation or capitalization.

Documentation comments should always be complete sentences, and as such should always be capitalized and punctuated. Simple end-of-line comments (especially for struct fields) can be simple phrases that assume the field name is the subject.

```
// Good:
// A Server handles serving quotes from the collected works of Shakespeare.
type Server struct {
 // BaseDir points to the base directory under which Shakespeare's works are stored.
 //
 // The directory structure is expected to be the following:
 // {BaseDir}/manifest.json
 // {BaseDir}/{name}/{name}-part{number}.txt
 BaseDir string
 WelcomeMessage string // displayed when user logs in
 ProtocolVersion string // checked against incoming requests
 PageLength int // lines per page when printing (optional; default: 20)
}
```
Packages should clearly document their intended usage. Try to provide a runnable example; examples show up in Godoc. Runnable examples belong in the test file, not the production source file. See this example (Godoc, source).

If it isn’t feasible to provide a runnable example, example code can be provided within code comments. As with other code and command-line snippets in comments, it should follow standard formatting conventions.

When naming parameters, consider how function signatures appear in Godoc. The name of the function itself and the type of the result parameters are often sufficiently clear.

```
// Good:
func (n *Node) Parent1() *Node
func (n *Node) Parent2() (*Node, error)
```
If a function returns two or more parameters of the same type, adding names can be useful.

```
// Good:
func (n *Node) Children() (left, right *Node, err error)
```
If the caller must take action on particular result parameters, naming them can help suggest what the action is:

```
// Good:
// WithTimeout returns a context that will be canceled no later than d duration
// from now.
//
// The caller must arrange for the returned cancel function to be called when
// the context is no longer needed to prevent a resource leak.
func WithTimeout(parent Context, d time.Duration) (ctx Context, cancel func())
```
In the code above, cancellation is a particular action a caller must take.
However, were the result parameters written as `(Context, func())` alone, it
would be unclear what is meant by “cancel function”.

Don’t use named result parameters when the names produce unnecessary repetition.

```
// Bad:
func (n *Node) Parent1() (node *Node)
func (n *Node) Parent2() (node *Node, err error)
```
Don’t name result parameters in order to avoid declaring a variable inside the function. This practice results in unnecessary API verbosity at the cost of minor implementation brevity.

Naked returns are acceptable only in a small function. Once it’s a medium-sized function, be explicit with your returned values. Similarly, do not name result parameters just because it enables you to use naked returns. Clarity is always more important than saving a few lines in your function.

It is always acceptable to name a result parameter if its value must be changed in a deferred closure.

Tip:Types can often be clearer than names in function signatures. GoTip #38: Functions as Named Types demonstrates this.In,

`WithTimeout`above, the real code uses a`CancelFunc`instead of a raw`func()`in the result parameter list and requires little effort to document.

Package comments must appear immediately above the package clause with no blank line between the comment and the package name. Example:

```
// Good:
// Package math provides basic constants and mathematical functions.
//
// This package does not guarantee bit-identical results across architectures.
package math
```
There must be a single package comment per package. If a package is composed of multiple files, exactly one of the files should have a package comment.

Comments for `main` packages have a slightly different form, where the name of
the `go_binary` rule in the BUILD file takes the place of the package name.

```
// Good:
// The seed_generator command is a utility that generates a Finch seed file
// from a set of JSON study configs.
package main
```
Other styles of comment are fine as long as the name of the binary is exactly as written in the BUILD file. When the binary name is the first word, capitalizing it is required even though it does not strictly match the spelling of the command-line invocation.

```
// Good:
// Binary seed_generator ...
// Command seed_generator ...
// Program seed_generator ...
// The seed_generator command ...
// The seed_generator program ...
// Seed_generator ...
```
Tips:

Example command-line invocations and API usage can be useful documentation. For Godoc formatting, indent the comment lines containing code.

If there is no obvious primary file or if the package comment is
extraordinarily long, it is acceptable to put the doc comment in a file
named `doc.go` with only the comment and the package clause.

Multiline comments can be used instead of multiple single-line comments. This is primarily useful if the documentation contains sections which may be useful to copy and paste from the source file, as with sample command-lines (for binaries) and template examples.

```
// Good:
/*
The seed_generator command is a utility that generates a Finch seed file
from a set of JSON study configs.
 seed_generator *.json | base64 > finch-seed.base64
*/
package template
```
Comments intended for maintainers and that apply to the whole file are typically placed after import declarations. These are not surfaced in Godoc and are not subject to the rules above on package comments.

Package imports shouldn’t normally be renamed, but there are cases where they must be renamed or where a rename improves readability.

Local names for imported packages must follow the guidance around package naming, including the prohibition on the use of underscores and capital letters. Try to be consistent by always using the same local name for the same imported package.

An imported package *must* be renamed to avoid a name collision with other
imports. (A corollary of this is that good package names
should not require renaming.) In the event of a name collision, prefer to rename
the most local or project-specific import.

Generated protocol buffer packages *must* be renamed to remove underscores from
their names, and their local names must have a `pb` suffix. See
proto and stub best practices for more
information.

```
// Good:
import (
 foosvcpb "path/to/package/foo_service_go_proto"
)
```
Lastly, an imported, non-autogenerated package *can* be renamed if it has an
uninformative name (e.g. `util` or `v1`) Do this sparingly: do not rename the
package if the code surrounding the use of the package conveys enough context.
When possible, prefer refactoring the package itself with a more suitable name.

```
// Good:
import (
 core "github.com/kubernetes/api/core/v1"
 meta "github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1beta1"
)
```
If you need to import a package whose name collides with a common local variable
name that you want to use (e.g. `url`, `ssh`) and you wish to rename the
package, the preferred way to do so is with the `pkg` suffix (e.g. `urlpkg`).
Note that it is possible to shadow a package with a local variable; this rename
is only necessary if the package still needs to be used when such a variable is
in scope.

Imports should be organized into the following groups, in order:

Standard library packages

Other (project and vendored) packages

Protocol Buffer imports (e.g., `fpb "path/to/foo_go_proto"`)

Import for side-effects
(e.g., `_ "path/to/package"`)

```
// Good:
package main
import (
 "fmt"
 "hash/adler32"
 "os"
 "github.com/dsnet/compress/flate"
 "golang.org/x/text/encoding"
 "google.golang.org/protobuf/proto"
 foopb "myproj/foo/proto/proto"
 _ "myproj/rpc/protocols/dial"
 _ "myproj/security/auth/authhooks"
)
```
`import _`)Packages that are imported only for their side effects (using the syntax ```
import
_ "package"
```
) may only be imported in a main package, or in tests that require
them.

Some examples of such packages include:

image/jpeg in image processing code

Avoid blank imports in library packages, even if the library indirectly depends on them. Constraining side-effect imports to the main package helps control dependencies, and makes it possible to write tests that rely on a different import without conflict or wasted build costs.

The following are the only exceptions to this rule:

You may use a blank import to bypass the check for disallowed imports in the nogo static checker.

You may use a blank import of the embed package
in a source file which uses the `//go:embed` compiler directive.

**Tip:** If you create a library package that indirectly depends on a
side-effect import in production, document the intended usage.

`import .`)The `import .` form is a language feature that allows bringing identifiers
exported from another package to the current package without qualification. See
the language spec for more.

Do **not** use this feature in the Google codebase; it makes it harder to tell
where the functionality is coming from.

```
// Bad:
package foo_test
import (
 "bar/testutil" // also imports "foo"
 . "foo"
)
var myThing = Bar() // Bar defined in package foo; no qualification needed.
```
```
// Good:
package foo_test
import (
 "bar/testutil" // also imports "foo"
 "foo"
)
var myThing = foo.Bar()
```
Use `error` to signal that a function can fail. By convention, `error` is the
last result parameter.

```
// Good:
func Good() error { /* ... */ }
```
Returning a `nil` error is the idiomatic way to signal a successful operation
that could otherwise fail. If a function returns an error, callers must treat
all non-error return values as unspecified unless explicitly documented
otherwise. Commonly, the non-error return values are their zero values, but this
cannot be assumed.

```
// Good:
func GoodLookup() (*Result, error) {
 // ...
 if err != nil {
 return nil, err
 }
 return res, nil
}
```
Exported functions that return errors should return them using the `error` type.
Concrete error types are susceptible to subtle bugs: a concrete `nil` pointer
can get wrapped into an interface and thus become a non-nil value (see the
Go FAQ entry on the topic).

```
// Bad:
func Bad() *os.PathError { /*...*/ }
```
**Tip:** A function that takes a `context.Context` argument should usually
return an `error` so that the caller can determine if the context was cancelled
while the function was running.

Error strings should not be capitalized (unless beginning with an exported name, a proper noun or an acronym) and should not end with punctuation. This is because error strings usually appear within other context before being printed to the user.

```
// Bad:
err := fmt.Errorf("Something bad happened.")
```
```
// Good:
err := fmt.Errorf("something bad happened")
```
On the other hand, the style for the full displayed message (logging, test failure, API response, or other UI) depends, but should typically be capitalized.

```
// Good:
log.Infof("Operation aborted: %v", err)
log.Errorf("Operation aborted: %v", err)
t.Errorf("Op(%q) failed unexpectedly; err=%v", args, err)
```
Code that encounters an error should make a deliberate choice about how to
handle it. It is not usually appropriate to discard errors using `_` variables.
If a function returns an error, do one of the following:

`log.Fatal` or (if absolutely necessary)
`panic`.**Note:** `log.Fatalf` is not the standard library log. See [#logging].

In the rare circumstance where it is appropriate to ignore or discard an error
(for example a call to `(*bytes.Buffer).Write` that is documented to never
fail), an accompanying comment should explain why this is safe.

```
// Good:
var b *bytes.Buffer
n, _ := b.Write(p) // never returns a non-nil error
```
For more discussion and examples of error handling, see Effective Go and best practices.

In C and similar languages, it is common for functions to return values like -1, null, or the empty string to signal errors or missing results. This is known as in-band error handling.

```
// Bad:
// Lookup returns the value for key or -1 if there is no mapping for key.
func Lookup(key string) int
```
Failing to check for an in-band error value can lead to bugs and can attribute errors to the wrong function.

```
// Bad:
// The following line returns an error that Parse failed for the input value,
// whereas the failure was that there is no mapping for missingKey.
return Parse(Lookup(missingKey))
```
Go’s support for multiple return values provides a better solution (see the Effective Go section on multiple returns). Instead of requiring clients to check for an in-band error value, a function should return an additional value to indicate whether its other return values are valid. This return value may be an error or a boolean when no explanation is needed, and should be the final return value.

```
// Good:
// Lookup returns the value for key or ok=false if there is no mapping for key.
func Lookup(key string) (value string, ok bool)
```
This API prevents the caller from incorrectly writing `Parse(Lookup(key))` which
causes a compile-time error, since `Lookup(key)` has 2 outputs.

Returning errors in this way encourages more robust and explicit error handling:

```
// Good:
value, ok := Lookup(key)
if !ok {
 return fmt.Errorf("no value for %q", key)
}
return Parse(value)
```
Some standard library functions, like those in package `strings`, return in-band
error values. This greatly simplifies string-manipulation code at the cost of
requiring more diligence from the programmer. In general, Go code in the Google
codebase should return additional values for errors.

Handle errors before proceeding with the rest of your code. This improves the
readability of the code by enabling the reader to find the normal path quickly.
This same logic applies to any block which tests a condition then ends in a
terminal condition (e.g., `return`, `panic`, `log.Fatal`).

Code that runs if the terminal condition is not met should appear after the `if`
block, and should not be indented in an `else` clause.

```
// Good:
if err != nil {
 // error handling
 return // or continue, etc.
}
// normal code
```
```
// Bad:
if err != nil {
 // error handling
} else {
 // normal code that looks abnormal due to indentation
}
```

Tip:If you are using a variable for more than a few lines of code, it is generally not worth using the`if`-with-initializer style. In these cases, it is usually better to move the declaration out and use a standard`if`statement:`// Good: x, err := f() if err != nil { // error handling return } // lots of code that uses x // across multiple lines``// Bad: if x, err := f(); err != nil { // error handling return } else { // lots of code that uses x // across multiple lines }`

See Go Tip #1: Line of Sight and TotT: Reduce Code Complexity by Reducing Nesting for more details.

Go has an exceptionally powerful composite literal syntax, with which it is
possible to express deeply-nested, complicated values in a single expression.
Where possible, this literal syntax should be used instead of building values
field-by-field. The `gofmt` formatting for literals is generally quite good, but
there are some additional rules for keeping these literals readable and
maintainable.

Struct literals must specify **field names** for types defined outside the
current package.

Include field names for types from other packages.

```
// Good:
// https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/csv#Reader
r := csv.Reader{
 Comma: ',',
 Comment: '#',
 FieldsPerRecord: 4,
}
```
The position of fields in a struct and the full set of fields (both of which are necessary to get right when field names are omitted) are not usually considered to be part of a struct’s public API; specifying the field name is needed to avoid unnecessary coupling.

```
// Bad:
r := csv.Reader{',', '#', 4, false, false, false, false}
```
For package-local types, field names are optional.

```
// Good:
okay := Type{42}
also := internalType{4, 2}
```
Field names should still be used if it makes the code clearer, and it is very common to do so. For example, a struct with a large number of fields should almost always be initialized with field names.

```
// Good:
okay := StructWithLotsOfFields{
 field1: 1,
 field2: "two",
 field3: 3.14,
 field4: true,
}
```
The closing half of a brace pair should always appear on a line with the same
amount of indentation as the opening brace. One-line literals necessarily have
this property. When the literal spans multiple lines, maintaining this property
keeps the brace matching for literals the same as brace matching for common Go
syntactic constructs like functions and `if` statements.

The most common mistake in this area is putting the closing brace on the same line as a value in a multi-line struct literal. In these cases, the line should end with a comma and the closing brace should appear on the next line.

```
// Good:
good := []*Type{{Key: "value"}}
```
```
// Good:
good := []*Type{
 {Key: "multi"},
 {Key: "line"},
}
```
```
// Bad:
bad := []*Type{
 {Key: "multi"},
 {Key: "line"}}
```
```
// Bad:
bad := []*Type{
 {
 Key: "value"},
}
```
Dropping whitespace between braces (aka “cuddling” them) for slice and array literals is only permitted when both of the following are true.

```
// Good:
good := []*Type{
 { // Not cuddled
 Field: "value",
 },
 {
 Field: "value",
 },
}
```
```
// Good:
good := []*Type{{ // Cuddled correctly
 Field: "value",
}, {
 Field: "value",
}}
```
```
// Good:
good := []*Type{
 first, // Can't be cuddled
 {Field: "second"},
}
```
```
// Good:
okay := []*pb.Type{pb.Type_builder{
 Field: "first", // Proto Builders may be cuddled to save vertical space
}.Build(), pb.Type_builder{
 Field: "second",
}.Build()}
```
```
// Bad:
bad := []*Type{
 first,
 {
 Field: "second",
 }}
```
Repeated type names may be omitted from slice and map literals. This can be helpful in reducing clutter. A reasonable occasion for repeating the type names explicitly is when dealing with a complex type that is not common in your project, when the repetitive type names are on lines that are far apart and can remind the reader of the context.

```
// Good:
good := []*Type{
 {A: 42},
 {A: 43},
}
```
```
// Bad:
repetitive := []*Type{
 &Type{A: 42},
 &Type{A: 43},
}
```
```
// Good:
good := map[Type1]*Type2{
 {A: 1}: {B: 2},
 {A: 3}: {B: 4},
}
```
```
// Bad:
repetitive := map[Type1]*Type2{
 Type1{A: 1}: &Type2{B: 2},
 Type1{A: 3}: &Type2{B: 4},
}
```
**Tip:** If you want to remove repetitive type names in struct literals, you can
run `gofmt -s`.

Zero-value fields may be omitted from struct literals when clarity is not lost as a result.

Well-designed APIs often employ zero-value construction for enhanced readability. For example, omitting the three zero-value fields from the following struct draws attention to the only option that is being specified.

```
// Bad:
import (
 "github.com/golang/leveldb"
 "github.com/golang/leveldb/db"
)
ldb := leveldb.Open("/my/table", &db.Options{
 BlockSize: 1<<16,
 ErrorIfDBExists: true,
 // These fields all have their zero values.
 BlockRestartInterval: 0,
 Comparer: nil,
 Compression: nil,
 FileSystem: nil,
 FilterPolicy: nil,
 MaxOpenFiles: 0,
 WriteBufferSize: 0,
 VerifyChecksums: false,
})
```
```
// Good:
import (
 "github.com/golang/leveldb"
 "github.com/golang/leveldb/db"
)
ldb := leveldb.Open("/my/table", &db.Options{
 BlockSize: 1<<16,
 ErrorIfDBExists: true,
})
```
Structs within table-driven tests often benefit from explicit field names,
especially when the test struct is not trivial. This allows the author to omit
the zero-valued fields entirely when the fields in question are not related to
the test case. For example, successful test cases should omit any error-related
or failure-related fields. In cases where the zero value is necessary to
understand the test case, such as testing for zero or `nil` inputs, the field
names should be specified.

**Concise**

```
tests := []struct {
 input string
 wantPieces []string
 wantErr error
}{
 {
 input: "1.2.3.4",
 wantPieces: []string{"1", "2", "3", "4"},
 },
 {
 input: "hostname",
 wantErr: ErrBadHostname,
 },
}
```
**Explicit**

```
tests := []struct {
 input string
 wantIPv4 bool
 wantIPv6 bool
 wantErr bool
}{
 {
 input: "1.2.3.4",
 wantIPv4: true,
 wantIPv6: false,
 },
 {
 input: "1:2::3:4",
 wantIPv4: false,
 wantIPv6: true,
 },
 {
 input: "hostname",
 wantIPv4: false,
 wantIPv6: false,
 wantErr: true,
 },
}
```
For most purposes, there is no functional difference between `nil` and the empty
slice. Built-in functions like `len` and `cap` behave as expected on `nil`
slices.

```
// Good:
import "fmt"
var s []int // nil
fmt.Println(s) // []
fmt.Println(len(s)) // 0
fmt.Println(cap(s)) // 0
for range s {...} // no-op
s = append(s, 42)
fmt.Println(s) // [42]
```
If you declare an empty slice as a local variable (especially if it can be the source of a return value), prefer the nil initialization to reduce the risk of bugs by callers.

```
// Good:
var t []string
```
```
// Bad:
t := []string{}
```
Do not create APIs that force their clients to make distinctions between nil and the empty slice.

```
// Good:
// Ping pings its targets.
// Returns hosts that successfully responded.
func Ping(hosts []string) ([]string, error) { ... }
```
```
// Bad:
// Ping pings its targets and returns a list of hosts
// that successfully responded. Can be empty if the input was empty.
// nil signifies that a system error occurred.
func Ping(hosts []string) []string { ... }
```
When designing interfaces, avoid making a distinction between a `nil` slice and
a non-`nil`, zero-length slice, as this can lead to subtle programming errors.
This is typically accomplished by using `len` to check for emptiness, rather
than `== nil`.

This implementation accepts both `nil` and zero-length slices as “empty”:

```
// Good:
// describeInts describes s with the given prefix, unless s is empty.
func describeInts(prefix string, s []int) {
 if len(s) == 0 {
 return
 }
 fmt.Println(prefix, s)
}
```
Instead of relying on the distinction as a part of the API:

```
// Bad:
func maybeInts() []int { /* ... */ }
// describeInts describes s with the given prefix; pass nil to skip completely.
func describeInts(prefix string, s []int) {
 // The behavior of this function unintentionally changes depending on what
 // maybeInts() returns in 'empty' cases (nil or []int{}).
 if s == nil {
 return
 }
 fmt.Println(prefix, s)
}
describeInts("Here are some ints:", maybeInts())
```
See in-band errors for further discussion.

Avoid introducing a line break if it would align the rest of the line with an indented code block. If this is unavoidable, leave a space to separate the code in the block from the wrapped line.

```
// Bad:
if longCondition1 && longCondition2 &&
 // Conditions 3 and 4 have the same indentation as the code within the if.
 longCondition3 && longCondition4 {
 log.Info("all conditions met")
}
```
See the following sections for specific guidelines and examples:

The signature of a function or method declaration should remain on a single line to avoid indentation confusion.

Function argument lists can make some of the longest lines in a Go source file. However, they precede a change in indentation, and therefore it is difficult to break the line in a way that does not make subsequent lines look like part of the function body in a confusing way:

```
// Bad:
func (r *SomeType) SomeLongFunctionName(foo1, foo2, foo3 string,
 foo4, foo5, foo6 int) {
 foo7 := bar(foo1)
 // ...
}
```
See best practices for a few options for shortening the call sites of functions that would otherwise have many arguments.

Lines can often be shortened by factoring out local variables.

```
// Good:
local := helper(some, parameters, here)
good := foo.Call(list, of, parameters, local)
```
Similarly, function and method calls should not be separated based solely on line length.

```
// Good:
good := foo.Call(long, list, of, parameters, all, on, one, line)
```
```
// Bad:
bad := foo.Call(long, list, of, parameters,
 with, arbitrary, line, breaks)
```
Avoid adding inline comments to specific function arguments where possible. Instead, use an option struct or add more detail to the function documentation.

```
// Good:
good := server.New(ctx, server.Options{Port: 42})
```
```
// Bad:
bad := server.New(
 ctx,
 42, // Port
)
```
If the API cannot be changed or if the local call is unusual (whether or not the call is too long), it is always permissible to add line breaks if it aids in understanding the call.

```
// Good:
canvas.RenderHeptagon(fillColor,
 x0, y0, vertexColor0,
 x1, y1, vertexColor1,
 x2, y2, vertexColor2,
 x3, y3, vertexColor3,
 x4, y4, vertexColor4,
 x5, y5, vertexColor5,
 x6, y6, vertexColor6,
)
```
Note that the lines in the above example are not wrapped at a specific column boundary but are grouped based on vertex coordinates and color.

Long string literals within functions should not be broken for the sake of line length. For functions that include such strings, a line break can be added after the string format, and the arguments can be provided on the next or subsequent lines. The decision about where the line breaks should go is best made based on semantic groupings of inputs, rather than based purely on line length.

```
// Good:
log.Warningf("Database key (%q, %d, %q) incompatible in transaction started by (%q, %d, %q)",
 currentCustomer, currentOffset, currentKey,
 txCustomer, txOffset, txKey)
```
```
// Bad:
log.Warningf("Database key (%q, %d, %q) incompatible in"+
 " transaction started by (%q, %d, %q)",
 currentCustomer, currentOffset, currentKey, txCustomer,
 txOffset, txKey)
```
An `if` statement should not be line broken; multi-line `if` clauses can lead to
indentation confusion.

```
// Bad:
// The second if statement is aligned with the code within the if block, causing
// indentation confusion.
if db.CurrentStatusIs(db.InTransaction) &&
 db.ValuesEqual(db.TransactionKey(), row.Key()) {
 return db.Errorf(db.TransactionError, "query failed: row (%v): key does not match transaction key", row)
}
```
If the short-circuit behavior is not required, the boolean operands can be extracted directly:

```
// Good:
inTransaction := db.CurrentStatusIs(db.InTransaction)
keysMatch := db.ValuesEqual(db.TransactionKey(), row.Key())
if inTransaction && keysMatch {
 return db.Error(db.TransactionError, "query failed: row (%v): key does not match transaction key", row)
}
```
There may also be other locals that can be extracted, especially if the conditional is already repetitive:

```
// Good:
uid := user.GetUniqueUserID()
if db.UserIsAdmin(uid) || db.UserHasPermission(uid, perms.ViewServerConfig) || db.UserHasPermission(uid, perms.CreateGroup) {
 // ...
}
```
```
// Bad:
if db.UserIsAdmin(user.GetUniqueUserID()) || db.UserHasPermission(user.GetUniqueUserID(), perms.ViewServerConfig) || db.UserHasPermission(user.GetUniqueUserID(), perms.CreateGroup) {
 // ...
}
```
`if` statements that contain closures or multi-line struct literals should
ensure that the braces match to avoid
indentation confusion.

```
// Good:
if err := db.RunInTransaction(func(tx *db.TX) error {
 return tx.Execute(userUpdate, x, y, z)
}); err != nil {
 return fmt.Errorf("user update failed: %s", err)
}
```
```
// Good:
if _, err := client.Update(ctx, &upb.UserUpdateRequest{
 ID: userID,
 User: user,
}); err != nil {
 return fmt.Errorf("user update failed: %s", err)
}
```
Similarly, don’t try inserting artificial linebreaks into `for` statements. You
can always let the line simply be long if there is no elegant way to refactor
it:

```
// Good:
for i, max := 0, collection.Size(); i < max && !collection.HasPendingWriters(); i++ {
 // ...
}
```
Often, though, there is:

```
// Good:
for i, max := 0, collection.Size(); i < max; i++ {
 if collection.HasPendingWriters() {
 break
 }
 // ...
}
```
`switch` and `case` statements should also remain on a single line.

```
// Good:
switch good := db.TransactionStatus(); good {
case db.TransactionStarting, db.TransactionActive, db.TransactionWaiting:
 // ...
case db.TransactionCommitted, db.NoTransaction:
 // ...
default:
 // ...
}
```
```
// Bad:
switch bad := db.TransactionStatus(); bad {
case db.TransactionStarting,
 db.TransactionActive,
 db.TransactionWaiting:
 // ...
case db.TransactionCommitted,
 db.NoTransaction:
 // ...
default:
 // ...
}
```
If the line is excessively long, indent all cases and separate them with a blank line to avoid indentation confusion:

```
// Good:
switch db.TransactionStatus() {
case
 db.TransactionStarting,
 db.TransactionActive,
 db.TransactionWaiting,
 db.TransactionCommitted:
 // ...
case db.NoTransaction:
 // ...
default:
 // ...
}
```
In conditionals comparing a variable to a constant, place the variable value on the left hand side of the equality operator:

```
// Good:
if result == "foo" {
 // ...
}
```
Instead of the less clear phrasing where the constant comes first (“Yoda style conditionals”):

```
// Bad:
if "foo" == result {
 // ...
}
```
To avoid unexpected aliasing and similar bugs, be careful when copying a struct
from another package. For example, synchronization objects such as `sync.Mutex`
must not be copied.

The `bytes.Buffer` type contains a `[]byte` slice and, as an optimization for
small strings, a small byte array to which the slice may refer. If you copy a
`Buffer`, the slice in the copy may alias the array in the original, causing
subsequent method calls to have surprising effects.

In general, do not copy a value of type `T` if its methods are associated with
the pointer type, `*T`.

```
// Bad:
b1 := bytes.Buffer{}
b2 := b1
```
Invoking a method that takes a value receiver can hide the copy. When you author an API, you should generally take and return pointer types if your structs contain fields that should not be copied.

These are acceptable:

```
// Good:
type Record struct {
 buf bytes.Buffer
 // other fields omitted
}
func New() *Record {...}
func (r *Record) Process(...) {...}
func Consumer(r *Record) {...}
```
But these are usually wrong:

```
// Bad:
type Record struct {
 buf bytes.Buffer
 // other fields omitted
}
func (r Record) Process(...) {...} // Makes a copy of r.buf
func Consumer(r Record) {...} // Makes a copy of r.buf
```
This guidance also applies to copying `sync.Mutex`.

Do not use `panic` for normal error handling. Instead, use `error` and multiple
return values. See the Effective Go section on errors.

Within `package main` and initialization code, consider `log.Exit` for errors
that should terminate the program (e.g., invalid configuration), as in many of
these cases a stack trace will not help the reader. Please note that
`log.Exit` calls `os.Exit` and any deferred functions will not be run.

For errors that indicate “impossible” conditions, namely bugs that should always
be caught during code review and/or testing, a function may reasonably return an
error or call `log.Fatal`.

Also see when panic is acceptable.

**Note:** `log.Fatalf` is not the standard library log. See [#logging].

Setup helper functions that stop the program on failure follow the naming
convention `MustXYZ` (or `mustXYZ`). In general, they should only be called
early on program startup, not on things like user input where normal Go error
handling is preferred.

This often comes up for functions called to initialize package-level variables exclusively at package initialization time (e.g. template.Must and regexp.MustCompile).

```
// Good:
func MustParse(version string) *Version {
 v, err := Parse(version)
 if err != nil {
 panic(fmt.Sprintf("MustParse(%q) = _, %v", version, err))
 }
 return v
}
// Package level "constant". If we wanted to use `Parse`, we would have had to
// set the value in `init`.
var DefaultVersion = MustParse("1.2.3")
```
The same convention may be used in test helpers that only stop the current test
(using `t.Fatal`). Such helpers are often convenient in creating test values,
for example in struct fields of table driven tests, as
functions that return errors cannot be directly assigned to a struct field.

```
// Good:
func mustMarshalAny(t *testing.T, m proto.Message) *anypb.Any {
 t.Helper()
 any, err := anypb.New(m)
 if err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("mustMarshalAny(t, m) = %v; want %v", err, nil)
 }
 return any
}
func TestCreateObject(t *testing.T) {
 tests := []struct{
 desc string
 data *anypb.Any
 }{
 {
 desc: "my test case",
 // Creating values directly within table driven test cases.
 data: mustMarshalAny(t, mypb.Object{}),
 },
 // ...
 }
 // ...
}
```
In both of these cases, the value of this pattern is that the helpers can be
called in a “value” context. These helpers should not be called in places where
it’s difficult to ensure an error would be caught or in a context where an error
should be checked (e.g., in many request handlers). For
constant inputs, this allows tests to easily ensure that the `Must` arguments
are well-formed, and for non-constant inputs it permits tests to validate that
errors are properly handled or propagated.

Where `Must` functions are used in a test, they should generally be
marked as a test helper and call `t.Fatal` on error (see
error handling in test helpers for
more considerations of using that).

They should not be used when ordinary error handling is possible (including with some refactoring):

```
// Bad:
func Version(o *servicepb.Object) (*version.Version, error) {
 // Return error instead of using Must functions.
 v := version.MustParse(o.GetVersionString())
 return dealiasVersion(v)
}
```
When you spawn goroutines, make it clear when or whether they exit.

Goroutines can leak by blocking on channel sends or receives. The garbage collector will not terminate a goroutine blocked on a channel even if no other goroutine has a reference to the channel.

Even when goroutines do not leak, leaving them in-flight when they are no longer needed can cause other subtle and hard-to-diagnose problems. Sending on a channel that has been closed causes a panic.

```
// Bad:
ch := make(chan int)
ch <- 42
close(ch)
ch <- 13 // panic
```
Modifying still-in-use inputs “after the result isn’t needed” can lead to data races. Leaving goroutines in-flight for arbitrarily long can lead to unpredictable memory usage.

Concurrent code should be written such that the goroutine lifetimes are obvious. Typically this will mean keeping synchronization-related code constrained within the scope of a function and factoring out the logic into synchronous functions. If the concurrency is still not obvious, it is important to document when and why the goroutines exit.

Code that follows best practices around context usage often helps make this
clear. It is conventionally managed with a `context.Context`:

```
// Good:
func (w *Worker) Run(ctx context.Context) error {
 var wg sync.WaitGroup
 // ...
 for item := range w.q {
 // process returns at latest when the context is cancelled.
 wg.Add(1)
 go func() {
 defer wg.Done()
 process(ctx, item)
 }()
 }
 // ...
 wg.Wait() // Prevent spawned goroutines from outliving this function.
}
```
There are other variants of the above that use raw signal channels like ```
chan
struct{}
```
, synchronized variables, condition variables, and
more. The important part is that the goroutine’s end is evident for subsequent
maintainers.

In contrast, the following code is careless about when its spawned goroutines finish:

```
// Bad:
func (w *Worker) Run() {
 // ...
 for item := range w.q {
 // process returns when it finishes, if ever, possibly not cleanly
 // handling a state transition or termination of the Go program itself.
 go process(item)
 }
 // ...
}
```
This code may look OK, but there are several underlying problems:

The code probably has undefined behavior in production, and the program may not terminate cleanly, even if the operating system releases the resources.

The code is difficult to test meaningfully due to the code’s indeterminate lifecycle.

The code may leak resources as described above.

Avoid creating interfaces until a real need exists. Focus on the required behavior rather than just abstract named patterns like “service” or “repository” and the like.

Do not wrap RPC clients in new manual interfaces just for the sake of abstraction or testing. Use real transports instead (testing RPC).

Do not define back doors or export test double implementations of an interface solely for testing. Prefer testing via the public API of the real implementation instead.

Design interfaces to be small for easier implementation and composition (GoTip #78: Minimal Viable Interfaces). Document interfaces appropriately including their contract, edge cases, and expected errors. Keep interface types unexported if they are only used internally within a package.

The consumer of the interface should define it (not the package implementing the interface), ensuring it includes only the methods they actually use. The producer package may export the interface if the interface is the product (a common protocol) to prevent interface redefinition bloat.

There is an adage: Functions should take interfaces as arguments but return
concrete types (GoTip #49: Accept Interfaces, Return Concrete Types).
Returning concrete types allows the caller to have access to every public method
and field of that specific implementation, not just the subset of methods
defined in a pre-chosen interface. The caller can still pass that concrete
result into any other function that expects an interface. Sometimes returning an
interface is acceptable for encapsulation (e.g., `error` interface), and certain
constructs like command, chaining, factory, and
strategy patterns.

Deeper discussion on interfaces exists in the Best Practices’ section on interfaces.

Generics (formally called “Type Parameters”) are allowed where they fulfill your business requirements. In many applications, a conventional approach using existing language features (slices, maps, interfaces, and so on) works just as well without the added complexity, so be wary of premature use. See the discussion on least mechanism.

When introducing an exported API that uses generics, make sure it is suitably documented. It’s highly encouraged to include motivating runnable examples.

Do not use generics just because you are implementing an algorithm or data structure that does not care about the type of its member elements. If there is only one type being instantiated in practice, start by making your code work on that type without using generics at all. Adding polymorphism later will be straightforward compared to removing abstraction that is found to be unnecessary.

Do not use generics to invent domain-specific languages (DSLs). In particular, refrain from introducing error-handling frameworks that might put a significant burden on readers. Instead prefer established error handling practices. For testing, be especially wary of introducing assertion libraries or frameworks that result in less useful test failures.

In general:

`any` type and excessive
type switching, consider generics.See also:

Do not pass pointers as function arguments just to save a few bytes. If a
function reads its argument `x` only as `*x` throughout, then the argument
shouldn’t be a pointer. Common instances of this include passing a pointer to a
string (`*string`) or a pointer to an interface value (`*io.Reader`). In both
cases, the value itself is a fixed size and can be passed directly.

This advice does not apply to large structs, or even small structs that may
increase in size. In particular, protocol buffer messages should generally be
handled by pointer rather than by value. The pointer type satisfies the
`proto.Message` interface (accepted by `proto.Marshal`, `protocmp.Transform`,
etc.), and protocol buffer messages can be quite large and often grow larger
over time.

A method receiver can be passed either as a value or a pointer, just as if it were a regular function parameter. The choice between the two is based on which method set(s) the method should be a part of.

**Correctness wins over speed or simplicity.** There are cases where you must
use a pointer value. In other cases, pick pointers for large types or as
future-proofing if you don’t have a good sense of how the code will grow, and
use values for simple plain old data.

The list below spells out each case in further detail:

If the receiver is a slice and the method doesn’t reslice or reallocate the slice, use a value rather than a pointer.

```
// Good:
type Buffer []byte
func (b Buffer) Len() int { return len(b) }
```
If the method needs to mutate the receiver, the receiver must be a pointer.

```
// Good:
type Counter int
func (c *Counter) Inc() { *c++ }
// See https://pkg.go.dev/container/heap.
type Queue []Item
func (q *Queue) Push(x Item) { *q = append([]Item{x}, *q...) }
```
If the receiver is a struct containing fields that
cannot safely be copied, use a pointer receiver. Common examples
are `sync.Mutex` and other synchronization types.

```
// Good:
type Counter struct {
 mu sync.Mutex
 total int
}
func (c *Counter) Inc() {
 c.mu.Lock()
 defer c.mu.Unlock()
 c.total++
}
```
**Tip:** Check the type’s Godoc for information about whether it is safe
or unsafe to copy.

If the receiver is a “large” struct or array, a pointer receiver may be more efficient. Passing a struct is equivalent to passing all of its fields or elements as arguments to the method. If that seems too large to pass by value, a pointer is a good choice.

For methods that will call or run concurrently with other functions that modify the receiver, use a value if those modifications should not be visible to your method; otherwise use a pointer.

If the receiver is a struct or array, any of whose elements is a pointer to something that may be mutated, prefer a pointer receiver to make the intention of mutability clear to the reader.

```
// Good:
type Counter struct {
 m *Metric
}
func (c *Counter) Inc() {
 c.m.Add(1)
}
```
If the receiver is a built-in type, such as an integer or a string, that does not need to be modified, use a value.

```
// Good:
type User string
func (u User) String() { return string(u) }
```
If the receiver is a map, function, or channel, use a value rather than a pointer.

```
// Good:
// See https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Header.
type Header map[string][]string
func (h Header) Add(key, value string) { /* omitted */ }
```
If the receiver is a “small” array or struct that is naturally a value type with no mutable fields and no pointers, a value receiver is usually the right choice.

```
// Good:
// See https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time.
type Time struct { /* omitted */ }
func (t Time) Add(d Duration) Time { /* omitted */ }
```
When in doubt, use a pointer receiver.

As a general guideline, prefer to make the methods for a type either all pointer methods or all value methods.

**Note:** There is a lot of misinformation about whether passing a value or a
pointer to a function can affect performance. The compiler can choose to pass
pointers to values on the stack as well as copying values on the stack, but
these considerations should not outweigh the readability and correctness of the
code in most circumstances. When the performance does matter, it is important to
profile both approaches with a realistic benchmark before deciding that one
approach outperforms the other.

`switch` and `break`Do not use `break` statements without target labels at the ends of `switch`
clauses; they are redundant. Unlike in C and Java, `switch` clauses in Go
automatically break, and a `fallthrough` statement is needed to achieve the
C-style behavior. Use a comment rather than `break` if you want to clarify the
purpose of an empty clause.

```
// Good:
switch x {
case "A", "B":
 buf.WriteString(x)
case "C":
 // handled outside of the switch statement
default:
 return fmt.Errorf("unknown value: %q", x)
}
```
```
// Bad:
switch x {
case "A", "B":
 buf.WriteString(x)
 break // this break is redundant
case "C":
 break // this break is redundant
default:
 return fmt.Errorf("unknown value: %q", x)
}
```

Note:If a`switch`clause is within a`for`loop, using`break`within`switch`does not exit the enclosing`for`loop.`for { switch x { case "A": break // exits the switch, not the loop } }`To escape the enclosing loop, use a label on the

`for`statement:`loop: for { switch x { case "A": break loop // exits the loop } }`

Synchronous functions return their results directly and finish any callbacks or channel operations before returning. Prefer synchronous functions over asynchronous functions.

Synchronous functions keep goroutines localized within a call. This helps to reason about their lifetimes, and avoid leaks and data races. Synchronous functions are also easier to test, since the caller can pass an input and check the output without the need for polling or synchronization.

If necessary, the caller can add concurrency by calling the function in a separate goroutine. However, it is quite difficult (sometimes impossible) to remove unnecessary concurrency at the caller side.

See also:

Use a *type definition*, `type T1 T2`, to define a new type. Use a
*type alias*, `type T1 = T2`, to refer to an existing type without defining a
new type. Type aliases are rare; their primary use is to aid migrating packages
to new source code locations. Don’t use type aliasing when it is not needed.

Go’s format functions (`fmt.Printf` etc.) have a `%q` verb which prints strings
inside double-quotation marks.

```
// Good:
fmt.Printf("value %q looks like English text", someText)
```
Prefer using `%q` over doing the equivalent manually, using `%s`:

```
// Bad:
fmt.Printf("value \"%s\" looks like English text", someText)
// Avoid manually wrapping strings with single-quotes too:
fmt.Printf("value '%s' looks like English text", someText)
```
Using `%q` is recommended in output intended for humans where the input value
could possibly be empty or contain control characters. It can be very hard to
notice a silent empty string, but `""` stands out clearly as such.

Go 1.18 introduces an `any` type as an alias to `interface{}`. Because it is
an alias, `any` is equivalent to `interface{}` in many situations and in others
it is easily interchangeable via an explicit conversion. Prefer to use `any` in
new code.

Go programs in the Google codebase use an internal variant of the
standard `flag` package. It has a similar interface but interoperates well
with internal Google systems. Flag names in Go binaries should prefer to use
underscores to separate words, though the variables that hold a flag’s value
should follow the standard Go name style (mixed caps). Specifically, the flag
name should be in snake case, and the variable name should be the equivalent
name in camel case.

```
// Good:
var (
 pollInterval = flag.Duration("poll_interval", time.Minute, "Interval to use for polling.")
)
```
```
// Bad:
var (
 poll_interval = flag.Int("pollIntervalSeconds", 60, "Interval to use for polling in seconds.")
)
```
Flags must only be defined in `package main` or equivalent.

General-purpose packages should be configured using Go APIs, not by punching through to the command-line interface; don’t let importing a library export new flags as a side effect. That is, prefer explicit function arguments or struct field assignment or much less frequently and under the strictest of scrutiny exported global variables. In the extremely rare case that it is necessary to break this rule, the flag name must clearly indicate the package that it configures.

If your flags are global variables, place them in their own `var` group,
following the imports section.

There is additional discussion around best practices for creating complex CLIs with subcommands.

See also:

Go programs in the Google codebase use a variant of the standard `log`
package. It has a similar but more powerful interface and interoperates well
with internal Google systems. An open source version of this library is
available as package `glog`, and open source Google projects may use that, but
this guide refers to it as `log` throughout.

**Note:** For abnormal program exits, this library uses `log.Fatal` to abort
with a stacktrace, and `log.Exit` to stop without one. There is no `log.Panic`
function as in the standard library.

**Tip:** `log.Info(v)` is equivalent `log.Infof("%v", v)`, and the same goes for
other logging levels. Prefer the non-formatting version when you have no
formatting to do.

See also:

Values of the `context.Context` type carry security credentials, tracing
information, deadlines, and cancellation signals across API and process
boundaries. Unlike C++ and Java, which in the Google codebase use thread-local
storage, Go programs pass contexts explicitly along the entire function call
chain from incoming RPCs and HTTP requests to outgoing requests.

When passed to a function or method, `context.Context` is always the first
parameter.

```
func F(ctx context.Context /* other arguments */) {}
```
Exceptions are:

`req.Context()`.In streaming RPC methods, where the context comes from the stream.

Code using gRPC streaming accesses a context from a `Context()` method in
the generated server type, which implements `grpc.ServerStream`. See
gRPC Generated Code documentation.

In test functions (e.g. `TestXXX`, `BenchmarkXXX`, `FuzzXXX`), where the
context comes from
`(testing.TB).Context()`.

In other entrypoint functions (see below for examples of such functions),
use `context.Background()`.

`main``init`

Note: It is very rare for code in the middle of a callchain to require creating a base context of its own using`context.Background()`. Always prefer taking a context from your caller, unless it’s the wrong context.You may come across server libraries (the implementation of Stubby, gRPC, or HTTP in Google’s server framework for Go) that construct a fresh context object per request. These contexts are immediately filled with information from the incoming request, so that when passed to the request handler, the context’s attached values have been propagated to it across the network boundary from the client caller. Moreover, these contexts’ lifetimes are scoped to that of the request: when the request is finished, the context is cancelled.

Unless you are implementing a server framework, you shouldn’t create contexts with

`context.Background()`in library code. Instead, prefer using context detachment, which is mentioned below, if there is an existing context available. If you think you do need`context.Background()`outside of entrypoint functions, discuss it with the Google Go style mailing list before committing to an implementation.

The convention that `context.Context` comes first in functions also applies to
test helpers.

```
// Good:
func readTestFile(ctx context.Context, t *testing.T, path string) string {}
```
Do not add a context member to a struct type. Instead, add a context parameter to each method on the type that needs to pass it along. The one exception is for methods whose signature must match an interface in the standard library or in a third party library outside Google’s control. Such cases are very rare, and should be discussed with the Google Go style mailing list before implementation and readability review.

**Note:** Go 1.24 added a `(testing.TB).Context()` method. In tests, prefer
using `(testing.TB).Context()` over `context.Background()` to provide the
initial `context.Context` used by the test. Helper functions, environment or
test double setup, and other functions called from the test function body that
require a context should have one explicitly passed.

Code in the Google codebase that must spawn background operations which can run after the parent context has been cancelled can use an internal package for detachment. Follow issue #40221 for discussions on an open source alternative.

Since contexts are immutable, it is fine to pass the same context to multiple calls that share the same deadline, cancellation signal, credentials, parent trace, and so on.

See also:

Do not create custom context types or use interfaces other than
`context.Context` in function signatures. There are no exceptions to this
rule.

Imagine if every team had a custom context. Every function call from package `p`
to package `q` would have to determine how to convert a `p.Context` to a
`q.Context`, for all pairs of packages `p` and `q`. This is impractical and
error-prone for humans, and it makes automated refactorings that add context
parameters nearly impossible.

If you have application data to pass around, put it in a parameter, in the
receiver, in globals, or in a `Context` value if it truly belongs there.
Creating your own context type is not acceptable since it undermines the ability
of the Go team to make Go programs work properly in production.

Do not use package `math/rand` to generate keys, even throwaway ones. If
unseeded, the generator is completely predictable. Seeded with
`time.Nanoseconds()`, there are just a few bits of entropy. Instead, use
`crypto/rand`’s Reader, and if you need text, print to hexadecimal or base64.

```
// Good:
import (
 "crypto/rand"
 // "encoding/base64"
 // "encoding/hex"
 "fmt"
 // ...
)
func Key() string {
 buf := make([]byte, 16)
 if _, err := rand.Read(buf); err != nil {
 log.Fatalf("Out of randomness, should never happen: %v", err)
 }
 return fmt.Sprintf("%x", buf)
 // or hex.EncodeToString(buf)
 // or base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(buf)
}
```
**Note:** `log.Fatalf` is not the standard library log. See [#logging].

It should be possible to diagnose a test’s failure without reading the test’s source. Tests should fail with helpful messages detailing:

Specific conventions for achieving this goal are outlined below.

Do not create “assertion libraries” as helpers for testing.

Assertion libraries are libraries that attempt to combine the validation and production of failure messages within a test (though the same pitfalls can apply to other test helpers as well). For more on the distinction between test helpers and assertion libraries, see best practices.

```
// Bad:
var obj BlogPost
assert.IsNotNil(t, "obj", obj)
assert.StringEq(t, "obj.Type", obj.Type, "blogPost")
assert.IntEq(t, "obj.Comments", obj.Comments, 2)
assert.StringNotEq(t, "obj.Body", obj.Body, "")
```
Assertion libraries tend to either stop the test early (if `assert` calls
`t.Fatalf` or `panic`) or omit relevant information about what the test got
right:

```
// Bad:
package assert
func IsNotNil(t *testing.T, name string, val any) {
 if val == nil {
 t.Fatalf("Data %s = nil, want not nil", name)
 }
}
func StringEq(t *testing.T, name, got, want string) {
 if got != want {
 t.Fatalf("Data %s = %q, want %q", name, got, want)
 }
}
```
Complex assertion functions often do not provide useful failure messages and context that exists within the test function. Too many assertion functions and libraries lead to a fragmented developer experience: which assertion library should I use, what style of output format should it emit, etc.? Fragmentation produces unnecessary confusion, especially for library maintainers and authors of large-scale changes, who are responsible for fixing potential downstream breakages. Instead of creating a domain-specific language for testing, use Go itself.

Assertion libraries often factor out comparisons and equality checks. Prefer
using standard libraries such as `cmp` and `fmt` instead:

```
// Good:
var got BlogPost
want := BlogPost{
 Comments: 2,
 Body: "Hello, world!",
}
if !cmp.Equal(got, want) {
 t.Errorf("Blog post = %v, want = %v", got, want)
}
```
For more domain-specific comparison helpers, prefer returning a value or an
error that can be used in the test’s failure message instead of passing
`*testing.T` and calling its error reporting methods:

```
// Good:
func postLength(p BlogPost) int { return len(p.Body) }
func TestBlogPost_VeritableRant(t *testing.T) {
 post := BlogPost{Body: "I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, your senior drill instructor."}
 if got, want := postLength(post), 60; got != want {
 t.Errorf("Length of post = %v, want %v", got, want)
 }
}
```
**Best Practice:** Were `postLength` non-trivial, it would make sense to test it
directly, independently of any tests that use it.

See also:

In most tests, failure messages should include the name of the function that
failed, even though it seems obvious from the name of the test function.
Specifically, your failure message should be `YourFunc(%v) = %v, want %v`
instead of just `got %v, want %v`.

In most tests, failure messages should include the function inputs if they are short. If the relevant properties of the inputs are not obvious (for example, because the inputs are large or opaque), you should name your test cases with a description of what’s being tested and print the description as part of your error message.

Test outputs should include the actual value that the function returned before
printing the value that was expected. A standard format for printing test
outputs is `YourFunc(%v) = %v, want %v`. Where you would write “actual” and
“expected”, prefer using the words “got” and “want”, respectively.

For diffs, directionality is less apparent, and as such it is important to include a key to aid in interpreting the failure. See the section on printing diffs. Whichever diff order you use in your failure messages, you should explicitly indicate it as a part of the failure message, because existing code is inconsistent about the ordering.

If your function returns a struct (or any data type with multiple fields such as slices, arrays, and maps), avoid writing test code that performs a hand-coded field-by-field comparison of the struct. Instead, construct the data that you’re expecting your function to return, and compare directly using a deep comparison.

**Note:** This does not apply if your data contains irrelevant fields that
obscure the intention of the test.

If your struct needs to be compared for approximate (or equivalent kind of
semantic) equality or it contains fields that cannot be compared for equality
(e.g., if one of the fields is an `io.Reader`), tweaking a `cmp.Diff` or
`cmp.Equal` comparison with `cmpopts` options such as
`cmpopts.IgnoreInterfaces` may meet your needs
(example).

If your function returns multiple return values, you don’t need to wrap those in a struct before comparing them. Just compare the return values individually and print them.

```
// Good:
val, multi, tail, err := strconv.UnquoteChar(`\"Fran & Freddie's Diner\"`, '"')
if err != nil {
 t.Fatalf(...)
}
if val != `"` {
 t.Errorf(...)
}
if multi {
 t.Errorf(...)
}
if tail != `Fran & Freddie's Diner"` {
 t.Errorf(...)
}
```
Avoid comparing results that may depend on output stability of a package that you do not own. Instead, the test should compare on semantically relevant information that is stable and resistant to changes in dependencies. For functionality that returns a formatted string or serialized bytes, it is generally not safe to assume that the output is stable.

For example, `json.Marshal` can change (and has changed in the past) the
specific bytes that it emits. Tests that perform string equality on the JSON
string may break if the `json` package changes how it serializes the bytes.
Instead, a more robust test would parse the contents of the JSON string and
ensure that it is semantically equivalent to some expected data structure.

Tests should keep going for as long as possible, even after a failure, in order to print out all of the failed checks in a single run. This way, a developer who is fixing the failing test doesn’t have to re-run the test after fixing each bug to find the next bug.

Prefer calling `t.Error` over `t.Fatal` for reporting a mismatch. When comparing
several different properties of a function’s output, use `t.Error` for each of
those comparisons.

```
// Good:
gotMean, gotVariance, err := MyDistribution(input)
if err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("MyDistribution(%v) returned unexpected error: %v", input, err)
}
if diff := cmp.Diff(wantMean, gotMean); diff != "" {
 t.Errorf("MyDistribution(%v) returned unexpected difference in mean value (-want +got):\n%s", input, diff)
}
if diff := cmp.Diff(wantVariance, gotVariance); diff != "" {
 t.Errorf("MyDistribution(%v) returned unexpected difference in variance value (-want +got):\n%s", input, diff)
}
```
Calling `t.Fatal` is primarily useful for reporting an unexpected condition
(such as an error or output mismatch) when subsequent failures would be
meaningless or even mislead the investigator. Note how the code below calls
`t.Fatalf` and *then* `t.Errorf`:

```
// Good:
gotEncoded := Encode(input)
if gotEncoded != wantEncoded {
 t.Fatalf("Encode(%q) = %q, want %q", input, gotEncoded, wantEncoded)
 // It doesn't make sense to decode from unexpected encoded input.
}
gotDecoded, err := Decode(gotEncoded)
if err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("Decode(%q) returned unexpected error: %v", gotEncoded, err)
}
if gotDecoded != input {
 t.Errorf("Decode(%q) = %q, want %q", gotEncoded, gotDecoded, input)
}
```
For table-driven test, consider using subtests and use `t.Fatal` rather than
`t.Error` and `continue`. See also
GoTip #25: Subtests: Making Your Tests Lean.

**Best practice:** For more discussion about when `t.Fatal` should be used, see
best practices.

The `==` operator evaluates equality using language-defined comparisons.
Scalar values (numbers, booleans, etc) are compared based on their values, but
only some structs and interfaces can be compared in this way. Pointers are
compared based on whether they point to the same variable, rather than based on
the equality of the values to which they point.

The `cmp` package can compare more complex data structures not appropriately
handled by `==`, such as slices. Use `cmp.Equal` for equality comparison and
`cmp.Diff` to obtain a human-readable diff between objects.

```
// Good:
want := &Doc{
 Type: "blogPost",
 Comments: 2,
 Body: "This is the post body.",
 Authors: []string{"isaac", "albert", "emmy"},
}
if !cmp.Equal(got, want) {
 t.Errorf("AddPost() = %+v, want %+v", got, want)
}
```
As a general-purpose comparison library, `cmp` may not know how to compare
certain types. For example, it can only compare protocol buffer messages if
passed the `protocmp.Transform` option.

```
// Good:
if diff := cmp.Diff(want, got, protocmp.Transform()); diff != "" {
 t.Errorf("Foo() returned unexpected difference in protobuf messages (-want +got):\n%s", diff)
}
```
Although the `cmp` package is not part of the Go standard library, it is
maintained by the Go team and should produce stable equality results over time.
It is user-configurable and should serve most comparison needs.

Existing code may make use of the following older libraries, and may continue using them for consistency:

`pretty` produces aesthetically pleasing difference reports. However, it
quite deliberately considers values that have the same visual representation
as equal. In particular, `pretty` does not catch differences between nil
slices and empty ones, is not sensitive to different interface
implementations with identical fields, and it is possible to use a nested
map as the basis for comparison with a struct value. It also serializes the
entire value into a string before producing a diff, and as such is not a
good choice for comparing large values. By default, it compares unexported
fields, which makes it sensitive to changes in implementation details in
your dependencies. For this reason, it is not appropriate to use `pretty` on
protobuf messages.Prefer using `cmp` for new code, and it is worth considering updating older code
to use `cmp` where and when it is practical to do so.

Older code may use the standard library `reflect.DeepEqual` function to compare
complex structures. `reflect.DeepEqual` should not be used for checking
equality, as it is sensitive to changes in unexported fields and other
implementation details. Code that is using `reflect.DeepEqual` should be updated
to one of the above libraries.

**Note:** The `cmp` package is designed for testing, rather than production use.
As such, it may panic when it suspects that a comparison is performed
incorrectly to provide instruction to users on how to improve the test to be
less brittle. Given cmp’s propensity towards panicking, it makes it unsuitable
for code that is used in production as a spurious panic may be fatal.

The conventional failure message, which is suitable for most Go tests, is
`YourFunc(%v) = %v, want %v`. However, there are cases that may call for more or
less detail:

`YourFunc` is called several times, identify which
call failed the test. If it’s important to know any extra state of the
system, include that in the failure output (or at least in the logs).`t.Fatalf("Setup: Failed to set up test database: %s", err)` is usually
helpful enough to resolve the issue.**Tip:** Make your failure mode trigger during development. Review what the
failure message looks like and whether a maintainer can effectively deal with
the failure.

There are some techniques for reproducing test inputs and outputs clearly:

`%q` is often useful to
emphasize that the value is important and to more easily spot bad values.`%+v` can be more useful than `%v`.If your function returns large output then it can be hard for someone reading the failure message to find the differences when your test fails. Instead of printing both the returned value and the wanted value, make a diff.

To compute diffs for such values, `cmp.Diff` is preferred, particularly for new
tests and new code, but other tools may be used. See types of equality for
guidance regarding the strengths and weaknesses of each function.

You can use the `diff` package to compare multi-line strings or lists of
strings. You can use this as a building block for other kinds of diffs.

Add some text to your failure message explaining the direction of the diff.

Something like `diff (-want +got)` is good when you’re using the `cmp`,
`pretty`, and `diff` packages (if you pass `(want, got)` to the function),
because the `-` and `+` that you add to your format string will match the
`-` and `+` that actually appear at the beginning of the diff lines. If you
pass `(got, want)` to your function, the correct key would be `(-got +want)`
instead.

The `messagediff` package uses a different output format, so the message
`diff (want -> got)` is appropriate when you’re using it (if you pass
`(want, got)` to the function), because the direction of the arrow will
match the direction of the arrow in the “modified” lines.

The diff will span multiple lines, so you should print a newline before you print the diff.

When a unit test performs string comparisons or uses a vanilla `cmp` to check
that particular kinds of errors are returned for particular inputs, you may find
that your tests are brittle if any of those error messages are reworded in the
future. Since this has the potential to turn your unit test into a change
detector (see TotT: Change-Detector Tests Considered Harmful ),
don’t use string comparison to check what type of error your function returns.
However, it is permissible to use string comparisons to check that error
messages coming from the package under test satisfy certain properties, for
example, that it includes the parameter name.

Error values in Go typically have a component intended for human eyes and a component intended for semantic control flow. Tests should seek to only test semantic information that can be reliably observed, rather than display information that is intended for human debugging, as this is often subject to future changes. For guidance on constructing errors with semantic meaning see best-practices regarding errors. If an error with insufficient semantic information is coming from a dependency outside your control, consider filing a bug against the owner to help improve the API, rather than relying on parsing the error message.

Within unit tests, it is common to only care whether an error occurred or not.
If so, then it is sufficient to only test whether the error was non-nil when you
expected an error. If you would like to test that the error semantically matches
some other error, then consider using `errors.Is` or `cmp` with
`cmpopts.EquateErrors`.

Note:If a test uses`cmpopts.EquateErrors`but all of its`wantErr`values are either`nil`or`cmpopts.AnyError`, then using`cmp`is unnecessary mechanism. Simplify the code by making the want field a`bool`. You can then use a simple comparison with`!=`.`// Good: err := f(test.input) if gotErr := err != nil; gotErr != test.wantErr { t.Errorf("f(%q) = %v, want error presence = %v", test.input, err, test.wantErr) }`

See also GoTip #13: Designing Errors for Checking.

The standard Go testing library offers a facility to define subtests. This allows flexibility in setup and cleanup, controlling parallelism, and test filtering. Subtests can be useful (particularly for table-driven tests), but using them is not mandatory. See also the Go blog post about subtests.

Subtests should not depend on the execution of other cases for success or
initial state, because subtests are expected to be able to be run individually
with using `go test -run` flags or with Bazel test filter expressions.

Name your subtest such that it is readable in test output and useful on the
command line for users of test filtering. When you use `t.Run` to create a
subtest, the first argument is used as a descriptive name for the test. To
ensure that test results are legible to humans reading the logs, choose subtest
names that will remain useful and readable after escaping. Think of subtest
names more like a function identifier than a prose description.

The test runner replaces spaces with underscores, and escapes non-printing characters. To ensure accurate correlation between test logs and source code, it is recommended to avoid using these characters in subtest names.

If your test data benefits from a longer description, consider putting the
description in a separate field (perhaps to be printed using `t.Log` or
alongside failure messages).

Subtests may be run individually using flags to the Go test runner or Bazel test filter, so choose descriptive names that are also easy to type.

Warning:Slash characters are particularly unfriendly in subtest names, since they have special meaning for test filters.`# Bad: # Assuming TestTime and t.Run("America/New_York", ...) bazel test :mytest --test_filter="Time/New_York" # Runs nothing! bazel test :mytest --test_filter="Time//New_York" # Correct, but awkward.`

To identify the inputs of the function, include them in the test’s failure messages, where they won’t be escaped by the test runner.

```
// Good:
func TestTranslate(t *testing.T) {
 data := []struct {
 name, desc, srcLang, dstLang, srcText, wantDstText string
 }{
 {
 name: "hu=en_bug-1234",
 desc: "regression test following bug 1234. contact: cleese",
 srcLang: "hu",
 srcText: "cigarettát és egy öngyújtót kérek",
 dstLang: "en",
 wantDstText: "cigarettes and a lighter please",
 }, // ...
 }
 for _, d := range data {
 t.Run(d.name, func(t *testing.T) {
 got := Translate(d.srcLang, d.dstLang, d.srcText)
 if got != d.wantDstText {
 t.Errorf("%s\nTranslate(%q, %q, %q) = %q, want %q",
 d.desc, d.srcLang, d.dstLang, d.srcText, got, d.wantDstText)
 }
 })
 }
}
```
Here are a few examples of things to avoid:

```
// Bad:
// Too wordy.
t.Run("check that there is no mention of scratched records or hovercrafts", ...)
// Slashes cause problems on the command line.
t.Run("AM/PM confusion", ...)
```
See also Go Tip #117: Subtest Names.

Use table-driven tests when many different test cases can be tested using similar testing logic.

`fmt.Sprintf` or the
minimal snippet below.`net.Dial`.Here is the minimal structure of a table-driven test. If needed, you may use different names or add extra facilities such as subtests or setup and cleanup functions. Always keep useful test failures in mind.

```
// Good:
func TestCompare(t *testing.T) {
 compareTests := []struct {
 a, b string
 want int
 }{
 {"", "", 0},
 {"a", "", 1},
 {"", "a", -1},
 {"abc", "abc", 0},
 {"ab", "abc", -1},
 {"abc", "ab", 1},
 {"x", "ab", 1},
 {"ab", "x", -1},
 {"x", "a", 1},
 {"b", "x", -1},
 // test runtime·memeq's chunked implementation
 {"abcdefgh", "abcdefgh", 0},
 {"abcdefghi", "abcdefghi", 0},
 {"abcdefghi", "abcdefghj", -1},
 }
 for _, test := range compareTests {
 got := Compare(test.a, test.b)
 if got != test.want {
 t.Errorf("Compare(%q, %q) = %v, want %v", test.a, test.b, got, test.want)
 }
 }
}
```
**Note**: The failure messages in this example above fulfill the guidance to
identify the function and
identify the input. There’s no need to
identify the row numerically.

When some test cases need to be checked using different logic from other test cases, it is appropriate to write multiple test functions, as explained in GoTip #50: Disjoint Table Tests.

When the additional test cases are simple (e.g., basic error checking) and don’t introduce conditionalized code flow in the table test’s loop body, it’s permissible to include that case in the existing test, though be careful using logic like this. What starts simple today can organically grow into something unmaintainable.

For example:

```
func TestDivide(t *testing.T) {
 tests := []struct {
 dividend, divisor int
 want int
 wantErr bool
 }{
 {
 dividend: 4,
 divisor: 2,
 want: 2,
 },
 {
 dividend: 10,
 divisor: 2,
 want: 5,
 },
 {
 dividend: 1,
 divisor: 0,
 wantErr: true,
 },
 }
 for _, test := range tests {
 got, err := Divide(test.dividend, test.divisor)
 if (err != nil) != test.wantErr {
 t.Errorf("Divide(%d, %d) error = %v, want error presence = %t", test.dividend, test.divisor, err, test.wantErr)
 }
 // In this example, we're only testing the value result when the tested function didn't fail.
 if err != nil {
 continue
 }
 if got != test.want {
 t.Errorf("Divide(%d, %d) = %d, want %d", test.dividend, test.divisor, got, test.want)
 }
 }
}
```
More complicated logic in your test code, like complex error checking based on conditional differences in test setup (often based on table test input parameters), can be difficult to understand when each entry in a table has specialized logic based on the inputs. If test cases have different logic but identical setup, a sequence of subtests within a single test function might be more readable. A test helper may also be useful for simplifying test setup in order to maintain the readability of a test body.

You can combine table-driven tests with multiple test functions. For example, when testing that a function’s output exactly matches the expected output and that the function returns a non-nil error for an invalid input, then writing two separate table-driven test functions is the best approach: one for normal non-error outputs, and one for error outputs.

Table test rows can sometimes become complicated, with the row values dictating conditional behavior inside the test case. The extra clarity from the duplication between the test cases is necessary for readability.

```
// Good:
type decodeCase struct {
 name string
 input string
 output string
 err error
}
func TestDecode(t *testing.T) {
 // setupCodex is slow as it creates a real Codex for the test.
 codex := setupCodex(t)
 var tests []decodeCase // rows omitted for brevity
 for _, test := range tests {
 t.Run(test.name, func(t *testing.T) {
 output, err := Decode(test.input, codex)
 if got, want := output, test.output; got != want {
 t.Errorf("Decode(%q) = %v, want %v", test.input, got, want)
 }
 if got, want := err, test.err; !cmp.Equal(got, want) {
 t.Errorf("Decode(%q) err %q, want %q", test.input, got, want)
 }
 })
 }
}
func TestDecodeWithFake(t *testing.T) {
 // A fakeCodex is a fast approximation of a real Codex.
 codex := newFakeCodex()
 var tests []decodeCase // rows omitted for brevity
 for _, test := range tests {
 t.Run(test.name, func(t *testing.T) {
 output, err := Decode(test.input, codex)
 if got, want := output, test.output; got != want {
 t.Errorf("Decode(%q) = %v, want %v", test.input, got, want)
 }
 if got, want := err, test.err; !cmp.Equal(got, want) {
 t.Errorf("Decode(%q) err %q, want %q", test.input, got, want)
 }
 })
 }
}
```
In the counterexample below, note how hard it is to distinguish between which
type of `Codex` is used per test case in the case setup. (The highlighted parts
run afoul of the advice from TotT: Data Driven Traps! .)

```
// Bad:
type decodeCase struct {
 name string
 input string
 codex testCodex
 output string
 err error
}
type testCodex int
const (
 fake testCodex = iota
 prod
)
func TestDecode(t *testing.T) {
 var tests []decodeCase // rows omitted for brevity
 for _, test := tests {
 t.Run(test.name, func(t *testing.T) {
 var codex Codex
 switch test.codex {
 case fake:
 codex = newFakeCodex()
 case prod:
 codex = setupCodex(t)
 default:
 t.Fatalf("Unknown codex type: %v", codex)
 }
 output, err := Decode(test.input, codex)
 if got, want := output, test.output; got != want {
 t.Errorf("Decode(%q) = %q, want %q", test.input, got, want)
 }
 if got, want := err, test.err; !cmp.Equal(got, want) {
 t.Errorf("Decode(%q) err %q, want %q", test.input, got, want)
 }
 })
 }
}
```
Do not use the index of the test in the test table as a substitute for naming your tests or printing the inputs. Nobody wants to go through your test table and count the entries in order to figure out which test case is failing.

```
// Bad:
tests := []struct {
 input, want string
}{
 {"hello", "HELLO"},
 {"wORld", "WORLD"},
}
for i, d := range tests {
 if strings.ToUpper(d.input) != d.want {
 t.Errorf("Failed on case #%d", i)
 }
}
```
Add a test description to your test struct and print it along failure messages. When using subtests, your subtest name should be effective in identifying the row.

**Important:** Even though `t.Run` scopes the output and execution, you must
always identify the input. The table test row names must follow the
subtest naming guidance.

A test helper is a function that performs a setup or cleanup task. All failures that occur in test helpers are expected to be failures of the environment (not from the code under test) — for example when a test database cannot be started because there are no more free ports on this machine.

If you pass a `*testing.T`, call `t.Helper` to attribute failures in the test
helper to the line where the helper is called. This parameter should come after
a context parameter, if present, and before any remaining
parameters.

```
// Good:
func TestSomeFunction(t *testing.T) {
 golden := readFile(t, "testdata/golden-result.txt")
 // ... tests against golden ...
}
// readFile returns the contents of a data file.
// It must only be called from the same goroutine as started the test.
func readFile(t *testing.T, filename string) string {
 t.Helper()
 contents, err := runfiles.ReadFile(filename)
 if err != nil {
 t.Fatal(err)
 }
 return string(contents)
}
```
Do not use this pattern when it obscures the connection between a test failure
and the conditions that led to it. Specifically, the guidance about
assert libraries still applies, and `t.Helper` should not be used
to implement such libraries.

**Tip:** For more on the distinction between test helpers and assertion helpers,
see best practices.

Although the above refers to `*testing.T`, much of the advice stays the same for
benchmark and fuzz helpers.

Tests may be defined in the same package as the code being tested.

To write a test in the same package:

`foo_test.go` file`package foo` for the test file```
# Good:
go_library(
 name = "foo",
 srcs = ["foo.go"],
 deps = [
 ...
 ],
)
go_test(
 name = "foo_test",
 size = "small",
 srcs = ["foo_test.go"],
 library = ":foo",
 deps = [
 ...
 ],
)
```
A test in the same package can access unexported identifiers in the package. This may enable better test coverage and more concise tests. Be aware that any examples declared in the test will not have the package names that a user will need in their code.

It is not always appropriate or even possible to define a test in the same
package as the code being tested. In these cases, use a package name with the
`_test` suffix. This is an exception to the “no underscores” rule to
package names. For example:

If an integration test does not have an obvious library that it belongs to

```
// Good:
package gmailintegration_test
import "testing"
```
If defining the tests in the same package results in circular dependencies

```
// Good:
package fireworks_test
import (
 "fireworks"
 "fireworkstestutil" // fireworkstestutil also imports fireworks
)
```
`testing`The Go standard library provides the `testing` package. This is the only
testing framework permitted for Go code in the Google codebase. In particular,
assertion libraries and third-party testing frameworks are not
allowed.

The `testing` package provides a minimal but complete set of functionality for
writing good tests:

These are designed to work cohesively with core language features like composite literal and if-with-initializer syntax to enable test authors to write [clear, readable, and maintainable tests].

A style guide cannot enumerate positive prescriptions for all matters, nor can it enumerate all matters about which it does not offer an opinion. That said, here are a few things where the readability community has previously debated and has not achieved consensus about.

`var i int` and `i := 0`

Overview | Guide | Decisions | Best practices

**Note:** This is part of a series of documents that outline Go Style
at Google. This document is **neither normative nor
canonical**, and is an auxiliary document to the
core style guide. See the overview for more information.

This file documents **guidance about how to best apply the Go Style Guide**.
This guidance is intended for common situations that arise frequently, but may
not apply in every circumstance. Where possible, multiple alternative approaches
are discussed along with the considerations that go into the decision about when
and when not to apply them.

See the overview for the full set of Style Guide documents.

When choosing the name for a function or method, consider the context in which the name will be read. Consider the following recommendations to avoid excess repetition at the call site:

The following can generally be omitted from function and method names:

For functions, do not repeat the name of the package.

```
// Bad:
package yamlconfig
func ParseYAMLConfig(input string) (*Config, error)
```
```
// Good:
package yamlconfig
func Parse(input string) (*Config, error)
```
For methods, do not repeat the name of the method receiver.

```
// Bad:
func (c *Config) WriteConfigTo(w io.Writer) (int64, error)
```
```
// Good:
func (c *Config) WriteTo(w io.Writer) (int64, error)
```
Do not repeat the names of variables passed as parameters.

```
// Bad:
func OverrideFirstWithSecond(dest, source *Config) error
```
```
// Good:
func Override(dest, source *Config) error
```
Do not repeat the names and types of the return values.

```
// Bad:
func TransformToJSON(input *Config) *jsonconfig.Config
```
```
// Good:
func Transform(input *Config) *jsonconfig.Config
```
When it is necessary to disambiguate functions of a similar name, it is acceptable to include extra information.

```
// Good:
func (c *Config) WriteTextTo(w io.Writer) (int64, error)
func (c *Config) WriteBinaryTo(w io.Writer) (int64, error)
```
There are some other common conventions when choosing names for functions and methods:

Functions that return something are given noun-like names.

```
// Good:
func (c *Config) JobName(key string) (value string, ok bool)
```
A corollary of this is that function and method names should
avoid the prefix `Get`.

```
// Bad:
func (c *Config) GetJobName(key string) (value string, ok bool)
```
Functions that do something are given verb-like names.

```
// Good:
func (c *Config) WriteDetail(w io.Writer) (int64, error)
```
Identical functions that differ only by the types involved include the name of the type at the end of the name.

```
// Good:
func ParseInt(input string) (int, error)
func ParseInt64(input string) (int64, error)
func AppendInt(buf []byte, value int) []byte
func AppendInt64(buf []byte, value int64) []byte
```
If there is a clear “primary” version, the type can be omitted from the name for that version:

```
// Good:
func (c *Config) Marshal() ([]byte, error)
func (c *Config) MarshalText() (string, error)
```
There are several disciplines you can apply to naming packages and types that provide test helpers and especially test doubles. A test double could be a stub, fake, mock, or spy.

These examples mostly use stubs. Update your names accordingly if your code uses fakes or another kind of test double.

Suppose you have a well-focused package providing production code similar to this:

```
package creditcard
import (
 "errors"
 "path/to/money"
)
// ErrDeclined indicates that the issuer declines the charge.
var ErrDeclined = errors.New("creditcard: declined")
// Card contains information about a credit card, such as its issuer,
// expiration, and limit.
type Card struct {
 // omitted
}
// Service allows you to perform operations with credit cards against external
// payment processor vendors like charge, authorize, reimburse, and subscribe.
type Service struct {
 // omitted
}
func (s *Service) Charge(c *Card, amount money.Money) error { /* omitted */ }
```
Suppose you want to create a package that contains test doubles for another.
We’ll use `package creditcard` (from above) for this example:

One approach is to introduce a new Go package based on the production one for
testing. A safe choice is to append the word `test` to the original package name
(“creditcard” + “test”):

```
// Good:
package creditcardtest
```
Unless stated explicitly otherwise, all examples in the sections below are in
`package creditcardtest`.

You want to add a set of test doubles for `Service`. Because `Card` is
effectively a dumb data type, similar to a Protocol Buffer message, it needs no
special treatment in tests, so no double is required. If you anticipate only
test doubles for one type (like `Service`), you can take a concise approach to
naming the doubles:

```
// Good:
import (
 "path/to/creditcard"
 "path/to/money"
)
// Stub stubs creditcard.Service and provides no behavior of its own.
type Stub struct{}
func (Stub) Charge(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error { return nil }
```
This is strictly preferable to a naming choice like `StubService` or the very
poor `StubCreditCardService`, because the base package name and its domain types
imply what `creditcardtest.Stub` is.

Finally, if the package is built with Bazel, make sure the new `go_library` rule
for the package is marked as `testonly`:

```
# Good:
go_library(
 name = "creditcardtest",
 srcs = ["creditcardtest.go"],
 deps = [
 ":creditcard",
 ":money",
 ],
 testonly = True,
)
```
The approach above is conventional and will be reasonably well understood by other engineers.

See also:

When one kind of stub is not enough (for example, you also need one that always
fails), we recommend naming the stubs according to the behavior they emulate.
Here we rename `Stub` to `AlwaysCharges` and introduce a new stub called
`AlwaysDeclines`:

```
// Good:
// AlwaysCharges stubs creditcard.Service and simulates success.
type AlwaysCharges struct{}
func (AlwaysCharges) Charge(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error { return nil }
// AlwaysDeclines stubs creditcard.Service and simulates declined charges.
type AlwaysDeclines struct{}
func (AlwaysDeclines) Charge(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error {
 return creditcard.ErrDeclined
}
```
But now suppose that `package creditcard` contains multiple types worth creating
doubles for, as seen below with `Service` and `StoredValue`:

```
package creditcard
type Service struct {
 // omitted
}
type Card struct {
 // omitted
}
// StoredValue manages customer credit balances. This applies when returned
// merchandise is credited to a customer's local account instead of processed
// by the credit issuer. For this reason, it is implemented as a separate
// service.
type StoredValue struct {
 // omitted
}
func (s *StoredValue) Credit(c *Card, amount money.Money) error { /* omitted */ }
```
In this case, more explicit test double naming is sensible:

```
// Good:
type StubService struct{}
func (StubService) Charge(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error { return nil }
type StubStoredValue struct{}
func (StubStoredValue) Credit(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error { return nil }
```
When variables in your tests refer to doubles, choose a name that most clearly differentiates the double from other production types based on context. Consider some production code you want to test:

```
package payment
import (
 "path/to/creditcard"
 "path/to/money"
)
type CreditCard interface {
 Charge(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error
}
type Processor struct {
 CC CreditCard
}
var ErrBadInstrument = errors.New("payment: instrument is invalid or expired")
func (p *Processor) Process(c *creditcard.Card, amount money.Money) error {
 if c.Expired() {
 return ErrBadInstrument
 }
 return p.CC.Charge(c, amount)
}
```
In the tests, a test double called a “spy” for `CreditCard` is juxtaposed
against production types, so prefixing the name may improve clarity.

```
// Good:
package payment
import "path/to/creditcardtest"
func TestProcessor(t *testing.T) {
 var spyCC creditcardtest.Spy
 proc := &Processor{CC: spyCC}
 // declarations omitted: card and amount
 if err := proc.Process(card, amount); err != nil {
 t.Errorf("proc.Process(card, amount) = %v, want nil", err)
 }
 charges := []creditcardtest.Charge{
 {Card: card, Amount: amount},
 }
 if got, want := spyCC.Charges, charges; !cmp.Equal(got, want) {
 t.Errorf("spyCC.Charges = %v, want %v", got, want)
 }
}
```
This is clearer than when the name is not prefixed.

```
// Bad:
package payment
import "path/to/creditcardtest"
func TestProcessor(t *testing.T) {
 var cc creditcardtest.Spy
 proc := &Processor{CC: cc}
 // declarations omitted: card and amount
 if err := proc.Process(card, amount); err != nil {
 t.Errorf("proc.Process(card, amount) = %v, want nil", err)
 }
 charges := []creditcardtest.Charge{
 {Card: card, Amount: amount},
 }
 if got, want := cc.Charges, charges; !cmp.Equal(got, want) {
 t.Errorf("cc.Charges = %v, want %v", got, want)
 }
}
```
**Note:** This explanation uses two informal terms, *stomping* and *shadowing*.
They are not official concepts in the Go language spec.

Like many programming languages, Go has mutable variables: assigning to a variable changes its value.

```
// Good:
func abs(i int) int {
 if i < 0 {
 i *= -1
 }
 return i
}
```
When using short variable declarations with the `:=` operator, in some cases a
new variable is not created. We can call this *stomping*. It’s OK to do this
when the original value is no longer needed.

```
// Good:
// innerHandler is a helper for some request handler, which itself issues
// requests to other backends.
func (s *Server) innerHandler(ctx context.Context, req *pb.MyRequest) *pb.MyResponse {
 // Unconditionally cap the deadline for this part of request handling.
 ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 3*time.Second)
 defer cancel()
 ctxlog.Info(ctx, "Capped deadline in inner request")
 // Code here no longer has access to the original context.
 // This is good style if when first writing this, you anticipate
 // that even as the code grows, no operation legitimately should
 // use the (possibly unbounded) original context that the caller provided.
 // ...
}
```
Be careful using short variable declarations in a new scope, though: that
introduces a new variable. We can call this *shadowing* the original variable.
Code after the end of the block refers to the original. Here is a buggy attempt
to shorten the deadline conditionally:

```
// Bad:
func (s *Server) innerHandler(ctx context.Context, req *pb.MyRequest) *pb.MyResponse {
 // Attempt to conditionally cap the deadline.
 if *shortenDeadlines {
 ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 3*time.Second)
 defer cancel()
 ctxlog.Info(ctx, "Capped deadline in inner request")
 }
 // BUG: "ctx" here again means the context that the caller provided.
 // The above buggy code compiled because both ctx and cancel
 // were used inside the if statement.
 // ...
}
```
A correct version of the code might be:

```
// Good:
func (s *Server) innerHandler(ctx context.Context, req *pb.MyRequest) *pb.MyResponse {
 if *shortenDeadlines {
 var cancel func()
 // Note the use of simple assignment, = and not :=.
 ctx, cancel = context.WithTimeout(ctx, 3*time.Second)
 defer cancel()
 ctxlog.Info(ctx, "Capped deadline in inner request")
 }
 // ...
}
```
In the case we called stomping, because there’s no new variable, the type being assigned must match that of the original variable. With shadowing, an entirely new entity is introduced so it can have a different type. Intentional shadowing can be a useful practice, but you can always use a new name if it improves clarity.

It is not a good idea to use variables with the same name as standard packages other than very small scopes, because that renders free functions and values from that package inaccessible. Conversely, when picking a name for your package, avoid names that are likely to require import renaming or cause shadowing of otherwise good variable names at the client side.

```
// Bad:
func LongFunction() {
 url := "https://example.com/"
 // Oops, now we can't use net/url in code below.
}
```
Go packages have a name specified on the `package` declaration, separate from
the import path. The package name matters more for readability than the path.

Go package names should be
related to what the package provides. Naming a
package just `util`, `helper`, `common` or similar is usually a poor choice (it
can be used as *part* of the name though). Uninformative names make the code
harder to read, and if used too broadly they are liable to cause needless
import conflicts.

Instead, consider what the callsite will look like.

```
// Good:
db := spannertest.NewDatabaseFromFile(...)
_, err := f.Seek(0, io.SeekStart)
b := elliptic.Marshal(curve, x, y)
```
You can tell roughly what each of these do even without knowing the imports list
(`cloud.google.com/go/spanner/spannertest`, `io`, and `crypto/elliptic`). With
less focused names, these might read:

```
// Bad:
db := test.NewDatabaseFromFile(...)
_, err := f.Seek(0, common.SeekStart)
b := helper.Marshal(curve, x, y)
```
If you’re asking yourself how big your Go packages should be and whether to place related types in the same package or split them into different ones, a good place to start is the Go blog post about package names. Despite the post title, it’s not solely about naming. It contains some helpful hints and cites several useful articles and talks.

Here are some other considerations and notes.

Users see godoc for the package in one page, and any methods exported by types
supplied by the package are grouped by their type. Godoc also group constructors
along with the types they return. If *client code* is likely to need two values
of different type to interact with each other, it may be convenient for the user
to have them in the same package.

Code within a package can access unexported identifiers in the package. If you
have a few related types whose *implementation* is tightly coupled, placing them
in the same package lets you achieve this coupling without polluting the public
API with these details. A good test for this coupling is to imagine a
hypothetical user of two packages, where the packages cover closely related
topics: if the user must import both packages in order to use either in any
meaningful way, combining them together is usually the right thing to do. The
standard library generally demonstrates this kind of scoping and layering well.

All of that being said, putting your entire project in a single package would
likely make that package too large. When something is conceptually distinct,
giving it its own small package can make it easier to use. The short name of the
package as known to clients together with the exported type name work together
to make a meaningful identifier: e.g. `bytes.Buffer`, `ring.New`. The
Package Names blog post has more examples.

Go style is flexible about file size, because maintainers can move code within a
package from one file to another without affecting callers. But as a general
guideline: it is usually not a good idea to have a single file with many
thousands of lines in it, or having many tiny files. There is no “one type, one
file” convention as in some other languages. As a rule of thumb, files should be
focused enough that a maintainer can tell which file contains something, and the
files should be small enough that it will be easy to find once there. The
standard library often splits large packages to several source files, grouping
related code by file. The source for package `bytes` is a good example.
Packages with long package documentation may choose to dedicate one file called
`doc.go` that has the package documentation, a
package declaration, and nothing else, but this is not required.

Within the Google codebase and in projects using Bazel, directory layout for Go
code is different than it is in open source Go projects: you can have multiple
`go_library` targets in a single directory. A good reason to give each package
its own directory is if you expect to open source your project in the future.

A few non-canonical reference examples to help demonstrate these ideas in action:

small packages that contain one cohesive idea that warrant nothing more being added nor nothing being removed:

`csv`: CSV data encoding and decoding with
responsibility split respectively between reader.go and writer.go.`expvar`: whitebox program telemetry all
contained in expvar.go.moderately sized packages that contain one large domain and its multiple responsibilities together:

`flag`: command line flag management all
contained in flag.go.large packages that divide several closely related domains across several files:

`http`: the core of HTTP:
client.go, support for HTTP clients;
server.go, support for HTTP servers; cookie.go, cookie
management.`os`: cross-platform operating system
abstractions: exec.go, subprocess management; file.go, file
management; tempfile.go, temporary files.See also:

Proto library imports are treated differently than standard Go imports due to their cross-language nature. The convention for renamed proto imports are based on the rule that generated the package:

`pb` suffix is generally used for `go_proto_library` rules.`grpc` suffix is generally used for `go_grpc_library` rules.Often a single word describing the package is used:

```
// Good:
import (
 foopb "path/to/package/foo_service_go_proto"
 foogrpc "path/to/package/foo_service_go_grpc"
)
```
Follow the style guidance for package names. Prefer whole words. Short names are good, but avoid ambiguity. When in doubt, use the proto package name up to _go with a pb suffix:

```
// Good:
import (
 pushqueueservicepb "path/to/package/push_queue_service_go_proto"
)
```
**Note:** Previous guidance encouraged very short names such as “xpb” or even
just “pb”. New code should prefer more descriptive names. Existing code which
uses short names should not be used as an example, but does not need to be
changed.

See the Go Style Decisions: Import grouping.

In Go, errors are values; they are created by code and consumed by code. Errors can be:

Error messages also show up across a variety of different surfaces including log messages, error dumps, and rendered UIs.

Code that processes (produces or consumes) errors should do so deliberately. It can be tempting to ignore or blindly propagate an error return value. However, it is always worth considering whether the current function in the call frame is positioned to handle the error most effectively. This is a large topic and it is hard to give categorical advice. Use your judgment, but keep the following considerations in mind:

While it is usually not appropriate to ignore an error, a reasonable exception
to this is when orchestrating related operations, where often only the first
error is useful. Package `errgroup` provides a convenient abstraction for a
group of operations that can all fail or be canceled as a group.

See also:

`errors``upspin.io/errors`If callers need to interrogate the error (e.g., distinguish different error conditions), give the error value structure so that this can be done programmatically rather than having the caller perform string matching. This advice applies to production code as well as to tests that care about different error conditions.

The simplest structured errors are unparameterized global values.

```
type Animal string
var (
 // ErrDuplicate occurs if this animal has already been seen.
 ErrDuplicate = errors.New("duplicate")
 // ErrMarsupial occurs because we're allergic to marsupials outside Australia.
 // Sorry.
 ErrMarsupial = errors.New("marsupials are not supported")
)
func process(animal Animal) error {
 switch {
 case seen[animal]:
 return ErrDuplicate
 case marsupial(animal):
 return ErrMarsupial
 }
 seen[animal] = true
 // ...
 return nil
}
```
The caller can simply compare the returned error value of the function with one of the known error values:

```
// Good:
func handlePet(...) {
 switch err := process(an); err {
 case ErrDuplicate:
 return fmt.Errorf("feed %q: %v", an, err)
 case ErrMarsupial:
 // Try to recover with a friend instead.
 alternate = an.BackupAnimal()
 return handlePet(..., alternate, ...)
 }
}
```
The above uses sentinel values, where the error must be equal (in the sense of
`==`) to the expected value. That is perfectly adequate in many cases. If
`process` returns wrapped errors (discussed below), you can use `errors.Is`.

```
// Good:
func handlePet(...) {
 switch err := process(an); {
 case errors.Is(err, ErrDuplicate):
 return fmt.Errorf("feed %q: %v", an, err)
 case errors.Is(err, ErrMarsupial):
 // ...
 }
}
```
Do not attempt to distinguish errors based on their string form. (See Go Tip #13: Designing Errors for Checking for more.)

```
// Bad:
func handlePet(...) {
 err := process(an)
 if regexp.MatchString(`duplicate`, err.Error()) {...}
 if regexp.MatchString(`marsupial`, err.Error()) {...}
}
```
If there is extra information in the error that the caller needs
programmatically, it should ideally be presented structurally. For example, the
`os.PathError` type is documented to place the pathname of the failing
operation in a struct field which the caller can easily access.

Other error structures can be used as appropriate, for example a project struct
containing an error code and detail string. Package `status` is a
common encapsulation; if you choose this approach (which you are not obligated
to do), use canonical codes. See
Go Tip #89: When to Use Canonical Status Codes as Errors
to know if using status codes is the right choice.

When adding information to errors, avoid redundant information that the
underlying error already provides. The `os` package, for instance, already
includes path information in its errors.

```
// Good:
if err := os.Open("settings.txt"); err != nil {
 return fmt.Errorf("launch codes unavailable: %v", err)
}
// Output:
//
// launch codes unavailable: open settings.txt: no such file or directory
```
Here, “launch codes unavailable” adds specific meaning to the `os.Open` error
that’s relevant to the current function’s context, without duplicating the
underlying file path information.

```
// Bad:
if err := os.Open("settings.txt"); err != nil {
 return fmt.Errorf("could not open settings.txt: %v", err)
}
// Output:
//
// could not open settings.txt: open settings.txt: no such file or directory
```
Don’t add an annotation if its sole purpose is to indicate a failure without adding new information. The presence of an error sufficiently conveys the failure to the caller.

```
// Bad:
return fmt.Errorf("failed: %v", err) // just return err instead
```
The
choice between `%v` and `%w` when wrapping errors
with `fmt.Errorf` is a nuanced decision that significantly impacts how errors
are propagated handled, inspected, and documented within your application. The
core principle is to make error values useful to their observers, whether those
observers are humans or code.

`%v` for simple annotation or new error

The `%v` verb is your general-purpose tool for string formatting of any Go
value, including errors. When used with `fmt.Errorf`, it embeds the string
representation of an error (what its `Error()` method returns) into a new
error value, dropping any structured information from the original error.
Examples to use `%v`:

Adding interesting, non-redundant context: as in the example above.

Logging or displaying errors: When the primary goal is to present a
human-readable error message in logs or to a user, and you don’t intend
for the caller to programmatically `errors.Is` or `errors.As` the error
(Note: `errors.Unwrap` is generally not recommended here as it doesn’t
handle multi-errors).

Creating fresh, independent errors: Sometimes it is necessary to transform an error into a new error message, thereby hiding the specifics of the original error. This practice is particularly beneficial at system boundaries, including but not limited to RPC, IPC, and storage, where we translate domain-specific errors into a canonical error space.

```
// Good:
func (*FortuneTeller) SuggestFortune(context.Context, *pb.SuggestionRequest) (*pb.SuggestionResponse, error) {
 // ...
 if err != nil {
 return nil, fmt.Errorf("couldn't find fortune database: %v", err)
 }
}
```
We could also explicitly annotate RPC code `Internal` to the example
above.

```
// Good:
import (
 "google.golang.org/grpc/codes"
 "google.golang.org/grpc/status"
)
func (*FortuneTeller) SuggestFortune(context.Context, *pb.SuggestionRequest) (*pb.SuggestionResponse, error) {
 // ...
 if err != nil {
 // Or use fmt.Errorf with the %w verb if deliberately wrapping an
 // error which the caller is meant to unwrap.
 return nil, status.Errorf(codes.Internal, "couldn't find fortune database", status.ErrInternal)
 }
}
```
`%w` (wrap) for programmatic inspection and error chaining

The `%w` verb is specifically designed for error wrapping. It creates a new
error that provides an `Unwrap()` method, allowing callers to
programmatically inspect the error chain using `errors.Is` and `errors.As`.
Examples to use `%w`:

Adding context while preserving the original error for programmatic inspection: This is the primary use case within helpers of your application. You want to enrich an error with additional context (e.g., what operation was being performed when it failed) but still allow the caller to check if the underlying error is a specific sentinel error or type.

```
// Good:
func (s *Server) internalFunction(ctx context.Context) error {
 // ...
 if err != nil {
 return fmt.Errorf("couldn't find remote file: %w", err)
 }
}
```
This allows a higher-level function to do ```
errors.Is(err,
fs.ErrNotExist)
```
 if the underlying error was `fs.ErrNotExist`, even
though it’s wrapped.

At points where your system interacts with external systems like RPC,
IPC, or storage, it’s often better to translate domain-specific errors
into a standardized error space (e.g., gRPC status codes) rather than
simply wrapping the raw underlying error with `%w`. The client typically
doesn’t care about the exact internal file system error; they care about
the canonical result (e.g., `Internal`, `NotFound`, `PermissionDenied`).

When you explicitly document and test the underlying errors you expose:
If your package’s API guarantees that certain underlying errors can be
unwrapped and checked by callers (e.g., “this function might return
`ErrInvalidConfig` wrapped within a more general error”), then `%w` is
appropriate. This forms part of your package’s contract.

See also:

Prefer to place `%w` at the end of an error string *if* you are to use
error wrapping with the `%w` formatting
verb.

Errors can be wrapped with the `%w` verb, or by placing them in a
structured error that
implements `Unwrap() error` (ex:
`fs.PathError`).

Wrapped errors form error chains: each new layer of wrapping adds a new entry to
the front of the error chain. The error chain can be traversed with the
`Unwrap() error` method. For example:

```
err1 := fmt.Errorf("err1")
err2 := fmt.Errorf("err2: %w", err1)
err3 := fmt.Errorf("err3: %w", err2)
```
This forms an error chain of the form,

```
flowchart LR
 err3 == err3 wraps err2 ==> err2;
 err2 == err2 wraps err1 ==> err1;
```
Regardless of where the `%w` verb is placed, the error returned always
represents the front of the error chain, and the `%w` is the next child.
Similarly, `Unwrap() error` always traverses the error chain from newest to
oldest error.

Placement of the `%w` verb does, however, affect whether the error chain is
printed newest to oldest, oldest to newest, or neither:

```
// Good:
err1 := fmt.Errorf("err1")
err2 := fmt.Errorf("err2: %w", err1)
err3 := fmt.Errorf("err3: %w", err2)
fmt.Println(err3) // err3: err2: err1
// err3 is a newest-to-oldest error chain, that prints newest-to-oldest.
```
```
// Bad:
err1 := fmt.Errorf("err1")
err2 := fmt.Errorf("%w: err2", err1)
err3 := fmt.Errorf("%w: err3", err2)
fmt.Println(err3) // err1: err2: err3
// err3 is a newest-to-oldest error chain, that prints oldest-to-newest.
```
```
// Bad:
err1 := fmt.Errorf("err1")
err2 := fmt.Errorf("err2-1 %w err2-2", err1)
err3 := fmt.Errorf("err3-1 %w err3-2", err2)
fmt.Println(err3) // err3-1 err2-1 err1 err2-2 err3-2
// err3 is a newest-to-oldest error chain, that neither prints newest-to-oldest
// nor oldest-to-newest.
```
Therefore, in order for error text to mirror error chain structure, prefer
placing the `%w` verb at the end with the form `[...]: %w`.

An exception to this rule is when wrapping sentinel errors. A sentinel error is an error that serves as a primary categorization of a failure. This helps observers quickly understand the nature of a failure (such as “not found” or “invalid argument”) without having to parse the entire error message. Identifying that error type as early as possible in the error string is beneficial.

Examples of sentinel errors include os errors (e.g., `os.ErrInvalid`) and
package-level errors.

In these cases, placing the `%w` verb at the beginning of the error string can
improve readability by immediately identifying the category of the error.

```
// Good:
package parser
var ErrParse = fmt.Errorf("parse error")
// This is another package error that could be returned.
var ErrParseInvalidHeader = fmt.Errorf("%w: invalid header", ErrParse)
func parseHeader() error {
 err := checkHeader()
 return fmt.Errorf("%w: invalid character in header: %v", ErrParseInvalidHeader, err)
}
err := fmt.Errorf("%w: couldn't find fortune database: %v", ErrInternal, err)
```
Placing the status at the beginning ensures that the most relevant categorical information is most prominent.

```
// Bad:
package parser
var ErrParse = fmt.Errorf("parse error")
// This is another package error that could be returned.
var ErrParseInvalidHeader = fmt.Errorf("%w: invalid header", ErrParse)
func parseHeader() error {
 err := checkHeader()
 return fmt.Errorf("invalid character in header: %v: %w", err, ErrParseInvalidHeader)
}
var ErrInternal = status.Error(codes.Internal, "internal")
err2 := fmt.Errorf("couldn't find fortune database: %v: %w", err, ErrInternal)
```
When you place it at the end, it makes it harder to identify the error category when reading the error text, as it’s buried in the specific error details.

Functions sometimes need to tell an external system about an error without propagating it to their callers. Logging is an obvious choice here; but be conscious of what and how you log errors.

Like good test failure messages, log messages should clearly express what went wrong and help the maintainer by including relevant information to diagnose the problem.

Avoid duplication. If you return an error, it’s usually better not to log it
yourself but rather let the caller handle it. The caller can choose to log
the error, or perhaps rate-limit logging using `rate.Sometimes`. Other
options include attempting recovery or even stopping the program. In any
case, giving the caller control helps avoid logspam.

The downside to this approach, however, is that any logging is written using the caller’s line coordinates.

Be careful with PII. Many log sinks are not appropriate destinations for sensitive end-user information.

Use `log.Error` sparingly. ERROR level logging causes a flush and is more
expensive than lower logging levels. This can have serious performance
impact on your code. When deciding between error and warning levels,
consider the best practice that messages at the error level should be
actionable rather than “more serious” than a warning.

Inside Google, we have monitoring systems that can be set up for more
effective alerting than writing to a log file and hoping someone notices it.
This is similar but not identical to the standard library
package `expvar`.

Use verbose logging (`log.V`) to your advantage. Verbose logging can be useful
for development and tracing. Establishing a convention around verbosity levels
can be helpful. For example:

`V(1)``V(2)``V(3)`To minimize the cost of verbose logging, you should ensure not to accidentally
call expensive functions even when `log.V` is turned off. `log.V` offers two
APIs. The more convenient one carries the risk of this accidental expense. When
in doubt, use the slightly more verbose style.

```
// Good:
for _, sql := range queries {
 log.V(1).Infof("Handling %v", sql)
 if log.V(2) {
 log.Infof("Handling %v", sql.Explain())
 }
 sql.Run(...)
}
```
```
// Bad:
// sql.Explain called even when this log is not printed.
log.V(2).Infof("Handling %v", sql.Explain())
```
Program initialization errors (such as bad flags and configuration) should be
propagated upward to `main`, which should call `log.Exit` with an error that
explains how to fix the error. In these cases, `log.Fatal` should not generally
be used, because a stack trace that points at the check is not likely to be as
useful as a human-generated, actionable message.

As stated in the decision against panics, standard error handling should be structured around error return values. Libraries should prefer returning an error to the caller rather than aborting the program, especially for transient errors.

It is occasionally necessary to perform consistency checks on an invariant and
terminate the program if it is violated. In general, this is only done when a
failure of the invariant check means that the internal state has become
unrecoverable. The most reliable way to do this in the Google codebase is to
call `log.Fatal`. Using `panic` in these cases is not reliable, because it is
possible for deferred functions to deadlock or further corrupt internal or
external state.

Similarly, resist the temptation to recover panics to avoid crashes, as doing so can result in propagating a corrupted state. The further you are from the panic, the less you know about the state of the program, which could be holding locks or other resources. The program can then develop other unexpected failure modes that can make the problem even more difficult to diagnose. Instead of trying to handle unexpected panics in code, use monitoring tools to surface unexpected failures and fix related bugs with a high priority.

**Note:** The standard `net/http` server violates this advice and recovers
panics from request handlers. Consensus among experienced Go engineers is that
this was a historical mistake. If you sample server logs from application
servers in other languages, it is common to find large stacktraces that are left
unhandled. Avoid this pitfall in your servers.

The standard library panics on API misuse. For example, `reflect` issues a
panic in many cases where a value is accessed in a way that suggests it was
misinterpreted. This is analogous to the panics on core language bugs such as
accessing an element of a slice that is out of bounds. Code review and tests
should discover such bugs, which are not expected to appear in production code.
These panics act as invariant checks that do not depend on a library, as the
standard library does not have access to the levelled `log` package that the
Google codebase uses.

Another case in which panics can be useful, though uncommon, is as an internal implementation detail of a package which always has a matching recover in the callchain. Parsers and similar deeply nested, tightly coupled internal function groups can benefit from this design, where plumbing error returns adds complexity without value.

The key attribute of this design is that these **panics are never allowed to
escape across package boundaries** and do not form part of the package’s API.
This is typically accomplished with a top-level deferred function that uses
`recover` to translate a propagated panic into a returned error at the public
API boundary. It requires the code that panics and recovers to distinguish
between panics that the code raises itself and those that it doesn’t:

```
// Good:
type syntaxError struct {
 msg string
}
func parseInt(in string) int {
 n, err := strconv.Atoi(in)
 if err != nil {
 panic(&syntaxError{"not a valid integer"})
 }
}
func Parse(in string) (_ *Node, err error) {
 defer func() {
 if p := recover(); p != nil {
 sErr, ok := p.(*syntaxError)
 if !ok {
 panic(p) // Propagate the panic since it is outside our code's domain.
 }
 err = fmt.Errorf("syntax error: %v", sErr.msg)
 }
 }()
 ... // Parse input calling parseInt internally to parse integers
}
```

Warning:Code employing this pattern must take care to manage any resources associated with the code run in such defer-managed sections (e.g., close, free, or unlock).

Panic is also used when the compiler cannot identify unreachable code, for
example when using a function like `log.Fatal` that will not return:

```
// Good:
func answer(i int) string {
 switch i {
 case 42:
 return "yup"
 case 54:
 return "base 13, huh"
 default:
 log.Fatalf("Sorry, %d is not the answer.", i)
 panic("unreachable")
 }
}
```
Do not call `log` functions before flags have been parsed.
If you must die in a package initialization function (an `init` or a
“must” function), a panic is acceptable in place of
the fatal logging call.

This section augments the decisions document’s commentary section.

Go code that is documented in familiar style is easier to read and less likely to be misused than something misdocumented or not documented at all. Runnable examples show up in Godoc and Code Search and are an excellent way of explaining how to use your code.

Not every parameter must be enumerated in the documentation. This applies to:

Document the error-prone or non-obvious fields and parameters by saying why they are interesting.

In the following snippet, the highlighted commentary adds little useful information to the reader:

```
// Bad:
// Sprintf formats according to a format specifier and returns the resulting
// string.
//
// format is the format, and data is the interpolation data.
func Sprintf(format string, data ...any) string
```
However, this snippet demonstrates a code scenario similar to the previous where the commentary instead states something non-obvious or materially helpful to the reader:

```
// Good:
// Sprintf formats according to a format specifier and returns the resulting
// string.
//
// The provided data is used to interpolate the format string. If the data does
// not match the expected format verbs or the amount of data does not satisfy
// the format specification, the function will inline warnings about formatting
// errors into the output string as described by the Format errors section
// above.
func Sprintf(format string, data ...any) string
```
Consider your likely audience in choosing what to document and at what depth. Maintainers, newcomers to the team, external users, and even yourself six months in the future may appreciate slightly different information from what is on your mind when you first come to write your docs.

It is implied that the cancellation of a context argument interrupts the
function it is provided to. If the function can return an error, conventionally
it is `ctx.Err()`.

This fact does not need to be restated:

```
// Bad:
// Run executes the worker's run loop.
//
// The method will process work until the context is cancelled and accordingly
// returns an error.
func (Worker) Run(ctx context.Context) error
```
Because that is implied, the following is better:

```
// Good:
// Run executes the worker's run loop.
func (Worker) Run(ctx context.Context) error
```
Where context behavior is different or non-obvious, it should be expressly documented if any of the following are true.

The function returns an error other than `ctx.Err()` when the context is
cancelled:

```
// Good:
// Run executes the worker's run loop.
//
// If the context is cancelled, Run returns a nil error.
func (Worker) Run(ctx context.Context) error
```
The function has other mechanisms that may interrupt it or affect lifetime:

```
// Good:
// Run executes the worker's run loop.
//
// Run processes work until the context is cancelled or Stop is called.
// Context cancellation is handled asynchronously internally: run may return
// before all work has stopped. The Stop method is synchronous and waits
// until all operations from the run loop finish. Use Stop for graceful
// shutdown.
func (Worker) Run(ctx context.Context) error
func (Worker) Stop()
```
The function has special expectations about context lifetime, lineage, or attached values:

```
// Good:
// NewReceiver starts receiving messages sent to the specified queue.
// The context should not have a deadline.
func NewReceiver(ctx context.Context) *Receiver
// Principal returns a human-readable name of the party who made the call.
// The context must have a value attached to it from security.NewContext.
func Principal(ctx context.Context) (name string, ok bool)
```
**Warning:** Avoid designing APIs that make such demands (like contexts not
having deadlines) from their callers. The above is only an example of how to
document this if it cannot be avoided, not an endorsement of the pattern.

Go users assume that conceptually read-only operations are safe for concurrent use and do not require extra synchronization.

The extra remark about concurrency can safely be removed in this Godoc:

```
// Len returns the number of bytes of the unread portion of the buffer;
// b.Len() == len(b.Bytes()).
//
// It is safe to be called concurrently by multiple goroutines.
func (*Buffer) Len() int
```
Mutating operations, however, are not assumed to be safe for concurrent use and require the user to consider synchronization.

Similarly, the extra remark about concurrency can safely be removed here:

```
// Grow grows the buffer's capacity.
//
// It is not safe to be called concurrently by multiple goroutines.
func (*Buffer) Grow(n int)
```
Documentation is strongly encouraged if any of the following are true.

It is unclear whether the operation is read-only or mutating:

```
// Good:
package lrucache
// Lookup returns the data associated with the key from the cache.
//
// This operation is not safe for concurrent use.
func (*Cache) Lookup(key string) (data []byte, ok bool)
```
Why? A cache hit when looking up the key mutate a LRU cache internally. How this is implemented may not be obvious to all readers.

Synchronization is provided by the API:

```
// Good:
package fortune_go_proto
// NewFortuneTellerClient returns an *rpc.Client for the FortuneTeller service.
// It is safe for simultaneous use by multiple goroutines.
func NewFortuneTellerClient(cc *rpc.ClientConn) *FortuneTellerClient
```
Why? Stubby provides synchronization.

**Note:** If the API is a type and the API provides synchronization in
entirety, conventionally only the type definition documents the semantics.

The API consumes user-implemented types of interfaces, and the interface’s consumer has particular concurrency requirements:

```
// Good:
package health
// A Watcher reports the health of some entity (usually a backend service).
//
// Watcher methods are safe for simultaneous use by multiple goroutines.
type Watcher interface {
 // Watch sends true on the passed-in channel when the Watcher's
 // status has changed.
 Watch(changed chan<- bool) (unwatch func())
 // Health returns nil if the entity being watched is healthy, or a
 // non-nil error explaining why the entity is not healthy.
 Health() error
}
```
Why? Whether an API is safe for use by multiple goroutines is part of its contract.

Document any explicit cleanup requirements that the API has. Otherwise, callers won’t use the API correctly, leading to resource leaks and other possible bugs.

Call out cleanups that are up to the caller:

```
// Good:
// NewTicker returns a new Ticker containing a channel that will send the
// current time on the channel after each tick.
//
// Call Stop to release the Ticker's associated resources when done.
func NewTicker(d Duration) *Ticker
func (*Ticker) Stop()
```
If it is potentially unclear how to clean up the resources, explain how:

```
// Good:
// Get issues a GET to the specified URL.
//
// When err is nil, resp always contains a non-nil resp.Body.
// Caller should close resp.Body when done reading from it.
//
// resp, err := http.Get("http://example.com/")
// if err != nil {
// // handle error
// }
// defer resp.Body.Close()
// body, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
func (c *Client) Get(url string) (resp *Response, err error)
```
See also:

Document significant error sentinel values or error types that your functions return to callers so that callers can anticipate what types of conditions they can handle in their code.

```
// Good:
package os
// Read reads up to len(b) bytes from the File and stores them in b. It returns
// the number of bytes read and any error encountered.
//
// At end of file, Read returns 0, io.EOF.
func (*File) Read(b []byte) (n int, err error) {
```
When a function returns a specific error type, correctly note whether the error is a pointer receiver or not:

```
// Good:
package os
type PathError struct {
 Op string
 Path string
 Err error
}
// Chdir changes the current working directory to the named directory.
//
// If there is an error, it will be of type *PathError.
func Chdir(dir string) error {
```
Documenting whether the values returned are pointer receivers enables callers to
correctly compare the errors using `errors.Is`, `errors.As`, and
`package cmp`. This is because a non-pointer value is not equivalent to a
pointer value.

**Note:** In the `Chdir` example, the return type is written as `error` rather
than `*PathError` due to
how nil interface values work.

Document overall error conventions in the package’s documentation when the behavior is applicable to most errors found in the package:

```
// Good:
// Package os provides a platform-independent interface to operating system
// functionality.
//
// Often, more information is available within the error. For example, if a
// call that takes a file name fails, such as Open or Stat, the error will
// include the failing file name when printed and will be of type *PathError,
// which may be unpacked for more information.
package os
```
Thoughtful application of these approaches can add extra information to errors without much effort and help callers avoid adding redundant annotations.

Go features a documentation server. It is recommended to preview the documentation your code produces both before and during the code review process. This helps to validate that the godoc formatting is rendered correctly.

Godoc provides some specific syntax to format documentation.

A blank line is required to separate paragraphs:

```
// Good:
// LoadConfig reads a configuration out of the named file.
//
// See some/shortlink for config file format details.
```
Test files can contain runnable examples that appear attached to the corresponding documentation in godoc:

```
// Good:
func ExampleConfig_WriteTo() {
 cfg := &Config{
 Name: "example",
 }
 if err := cfg.WriteTo(os.Stdout); err != nil {
 log.Exitf("Failed to write config: %s", err)
 }
 // Output:
 // {
 // "name": "example"
 // }
}
```
Indenting lines by an additional two spaces formats them verbatim:

```
// Good:
// Update runs the function in an atomic transaction.
//
// This is typically used with an anonymous TransactionFunc:
//
// if err := db.Update(func(state *State) { state.Foo = bar }); err != nil {
// //...
// }
```
Note, however, that it can often be more appropriate to put code in a runnable example instead of including it in a comment.

This verbatim formatting can be leveraged for formatting that is not native to godoc, such as lists and tables:

```
// Good:
// LoadConfig reads a configuration out of the named file.
//
// LoadConfig treats the following keys in special ways:
// "import" will make this configuration inherit from the named file.
// "env" if present will be populated with the system environment.
```
A single line that begins with a capital letter, contains no punctuation except parentheses and commas, and is followed by another paragraph, is formatted as a header:

```
// Good:
// The following line is formatted as a heading.
//
// Using headings
//
// Headings come with autogenerated anchor tags for easy linking.
```
Sometimes a line of code looks like something common, but actually isn’t. One of
the best examples of this is an `err == nil` check (since `err != nil` is much
more common). The following two conditional checks are hard to distinguish:

```
// Good:
if err := doSomething(); err != nil {
 // ...
}
```
```
// Bad:
if err := doSomething(); err == nil {
 // ...
}
```
You can instead “boost” the signal of the conditional by adding a comment:

```
// Good:
if err := doSomething(); err == nil { // if NO error
 // ...
}
```
The comment draws attention to the difference in the conditional.

For consistency, prefer `:=` over `var` when initializing a new variable with a
non-zero value.

```
// Good:
i := 42
```
```
// Bad:
var i = 42
```
The following declarations use the zero value:

```
// Good:
var (
 coords Point
 magic [4]byte
 primes []int
)
```
You should declare values using the zero value when you want to convey an empty
value that **is ready for later use**. Using composite literals with explicit
initialization can be clunky:

```
// Bad:
var (
 coords = Point{X: 0, Y: 0}
 magic = [4]byte{0, 0, 0, 0}
 primes = []int(nil)
)
```
A common application of zero value declaration is when using a variable as the output when unmarshalling:

```
// Good:
var coords Point
if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &coords); err != nil {
```
It is also okay to use the zero value in the following form when you need a variable of a pointer type:

```
// Good:
msg := new(pb.Bar) // or "&pb.Bar{}"
if err := proto.Unmarshal(data, msg); err != nil {
```
If you need a lock or other field that must not be copied in your struct, you can make it a value type to take advantage of zero value initialization. It does mean that the containing type must now be passed via a pointer and not a value. Methods on the type must take pointer receivers.

```
// Good:
type Counter struct {
 // This field does not have to be "*sync.Mutex". However,
 // users must now pass *Counter objects between themselves, not Counter.
 mu sync.Mutex
 data map[string]int64
}
// Note this must be a pointer receiver to prevent copying.
func (c *Counter) IncrementBy(name string, n int64)
```
It’s acceptable to use value types for local variables of composites (such as structs and arrays) even if they contain such uncopyable fields. However, if the composite is returned by the function, or if all accesses to it end up needing to take an address anyway, prefer declaring the variable as a pointer type at the outset. Similarly, protobuf messages should be declared as pointer types.

```
// Good:
func NewCounter(name string) *Counter {
 c := new(Counter) // "&Counter{}" is also fine.
 registerCounter(name, c)
 return c
}
var msg = new(pb.Bar) // or "&pb.Bar{}".
```
This is because `*pb.Something` satisfies `proto.Message` while `pb.Something`
does not.

```
// Bad:
func NewCounter(name string) *Counter {
 var c Counter
 registerCounter(name, &c)
 return &c
}
var msg = pb.Bar{}
```

Important:Map types must be explicitly initialized before they can be modified. However, reading from zero-value maps is perfectly fine.For map and slice types, if the code is particularly performance sensitive and if you know the sizes in advance, see the size hints section.

The following are composite literal declarations:

```
// Good:
var (
 coords = Point{X: x, Y: y}
 magic = [4]byte{'I', 'W', 'A', 'D'}
 primes = []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11}
 captains = map[string]string{"Kirk": "James Tiberius", "Picard": "Jean-Luc"}
)
```
You should declare a value using a composite literal when you know initial elements or members.

In contrast, using composite literals to declare empty or memberless values can be visually noisy compared to zero-value initialization.

When you need a pointer to a zero value, you have two options: empty composite
literals and `new`. Both are fine, but the `new` keyword can serve to remind the
reader that if a non-zero value were needed, a composite literal wouldn’t work:

```
// Good:
var (
 buf = new(bytes.Buffer) // non-empty Buffers are initialized with constructors.
 msg = new(pb.Message) // non-empty proto messages are initialized with builders or by setting fields one by one.
)
```
The following are declarations that take advantage of size hints in order to preallocate capacity:

```
// Good:
var (
 // Preferred buffer size for target filesystem: st_blksize.
 buf = make([]byte, 131072)
 // Typically process up to 8-10 elements per run (16 is a safe assumption).
 q = make([]Node, 0, 16)
 // Each shard processes shardSize (typically 32000+) elements.
 seen = make(map[string]bool, shardSize)
)
```
Size hints and preallocation are important steps **when combined with empirical
analysis of the code and its integrations**, to create performance-sensitive and
resource-efficient code.

Most code does not need a size hint or preallocation, and can allow the runtime to grow the slice or map as necessary. It is acceptable to preallocate when the final size is known (e.g. when converting between a map and a slice) but this is not a readability requirement, and may not be worth the clutter in small cases.

**Warning:** Preallocating more memory than you need can waste memory in the
fleet or even harm performance. When in doubt, see
GoTip #3: Benchmarking Go Code and default to a
zero initialization or a
composite literal declaration.

Specify channel direction where possible.

```
// Good:
// sum computes the sum of all of the values. It reads from the channel until
// the channel is closed.
func sum(values <-chan int) int {
 // ...
}
```
This prevents casual programming errors that are possible without specification:

```
// Bad:
func sum(values chan int) (out int) {
 for v := range values {
 out += v
 }
 // values must already be closed for this code to be reachable, which means
 // a second close triggers a panic.
 close(values)
}
```
When the direction is specified, the compiler catches simple errors like this. It also helps to convey a measure of ownership to the type.

Don’t let the signature of a function get too long. As more parameters are added to a function, the role of individual parameters becomes less clear, and adjacent parameters of the same type become easier to confuse. Functions with large numbers of arguments are less memorable and more difficult to read at the call-site.

When designing an API, consider splitting a highly configurable function whose signature is growing complex into several simpler ones. These can share an (unexported) implementation if necessary.

Where a function requires many inputs, consider introducing an option struct for some of the arguments or employing the more advanced variadic options technique. The primary consideration for which strategy to choose should be how the function call looks across all expected use cases.

The recommendations below primarily apply to exported APIs, which are held to a higher standard than unexported ones. These techniques may be unnecessary for your use case. Use your judgment, and balance the principles of clarity and least mechanism.

See also: Go Tip #24: Use Case-Specific Constructions

An option structure is a struct type that collects some or all of the arguments of a function or method, that is then passed as the last argument to the function or method. (The struct should be exported only if it is used in an exported function.)

Using an option structure has a number of benefits:

Here is an example of a function that could be improved:

```
// Bad:
func EnableReplication(ctx context.Context, config *replicator.Config, primaryRegions, readonlyRegions []string, replicateExisting, overwritePolicies bool, replicationInterval time.Duration, copyWorkers int, healthWatcher health.Watcher) {
 // ...
}
```
The function above could be rewritten with an option structure as follows:

```
// Good:
type ReplicationOptions struct {
 Config *replicator.Config
 PrimaryRegions []string
 ReadonlyRegions []string
 ReplicateExisting bool
 OverwritePolicies bool
 ReplicationInterval time.Duration
 CopyWorkers int
 HealthWatcher health.Watcher
}
func EnableReplication(ctx context.Context, opts ReplicationOptions) {
 // ...
}
```
The function can then be called in a different package:

```
// Good:
func foo(ctx context.Context) {
 // Complex call:
 storage.EnableReplication(ctx, storage.ReplicationOptions{
 Config: config,
 PrimaryRegions: []string{"us-east1", "us-central2", "us-west3"},
 ReadonlyRegions: []string{"us-east5", "us-central6"},
 OverwritePolicies: true,
 ReplicationInterval: 1 * time.Hour,
 CopyWorkers: 100,
 HealthWatcher: watcher,
 })
 // Simple call:
 storage.EnableReplication(ctx, storage.ReplicationOptions{
 Config: config,
 PrimaryRegions: []string{"us-east1", "us-central2", "us-west3"},
 })
}
```
**Note:** Contexts are never included in option structs.

This option is often preferred when some of the following apply:

Using variadic options, exported functions are created which return closures
that can be passed to the variadic (`...`) parameter of a function. The
function takes as its parameters the values of the option (if any), and the
returned closure accepts a mutable reference (usually a pointer to a struct
type) that will be updated based on the inputs.

Using variadic options can provide a number of benefits:

```
cartesian.Translate(dx, dy
int) TransformOption
```
).**Note:** Using variadic options requires a substantial amount of additional
code (see the following example), so it should only be used when the advantages
outweigh the overhead.

Here is an example of a function that could be improved:

```
// Bad:
func EnableReplication(ctx context.Context, config *placer.Config, primaryCells, readonlyCells []string, replicateExisting, overwritePolicies bool, replicationInterval time.Duration, copyWorkers int, healthWatcher health.Watcher) {
 ...
}
```
The example above could be rewritten with variadic options as follows:

```
// Good:
type replicationOptions struct {
 readonlyCells []string
 replicateExisting bool
 overwritePolicies bool
 replicationInterval time.Duration
 copyWorkers int
 healthWatcher health.Watcher
}
// A ReplicationOption configures EnableReplication.
type ReplicationOption func(*replicationOptions)
// ReadonlyCells adds additional cells that should additionally
// contain read-only replicas of the data.
//
// Passing this option multiple times will add additional
// read-only cells.
//
// Default: none
func ReadonlyCells(cells ...string) ReplicationOption {
 return func(opts *replicationOptions) {
 opts.readonlyCells = append(opts.readonlyCells, cells...)
 }
}
// ReplicateExisting controls whether files that already exist in the
// primary cells will be replicated. Otherwise, only newly-added
// files will be candidates for replication.
//
// Passing this option again will overwrite earlier values.
//
// Default: false
func ReplicateExisting(enabled bool) ReplicationOption {
 return func(opts *replicationOptions) {
 opts.replicateExisting = enabled
 }
}
// ... other options ...
// DefaultReplicationOptions control the default values before
// applying options passed to EnableReplication.
var DefaultReplicationOptions = []ReplicationOption{
 OverwritePolicies(true),
 ReplicationInterval(12 * time.Hour),
 CopyWorkers(10),
}
func EnableReplication(ctx context.Context, config *placer.Config, primaryCells []string, opts ...ReplicationOption) {
 var options replicationOptions
 for _, opt := range DefaultReplicationOptions {
 opt(&options)
 }
 for _, opt := range opts {
 opt(&options)
 }
}
```
The function can then be called in a different package:

```
// Good:
func foo(ctx context.Context) {
 // Complex call:
 storage.EnableReplication(ctx, config, []string{"po", "is", "ea"},
 storage.ReadonlyCells("ix", "gg"),
 storage.OverwritePolicies(true),
 storage.ReplicationInterval(1*time.Hour),
 storage.CopyWorkers(100),
 storage.HealthWatcher(watcher),
 )
 // Simple call:
 storage.EnableReplication(ctx, config, []string{"po", "is", "ea"})
}
```
Prefer this option when many of the following apply:

`error`).Options in this style should accept parameters rather than using presence to
signal their value; the latter can make dynamic composition of arguments much
more difficult. For example, binary settings should accept a boolean (e.g.
`rpc.FailFast(enable bool)` is preferable to `rpc.EnableFailFast()`). An
enumerated option should accept an enumerated constant (e.g.
`log.Format(log.Capacitor)` is preferable to `log.CapacitorFormat()`). The
alternative makes it much more difficult for users who must programmatically
choose which options to pass; such users are forced to change the actual
composition of the parameters rather than simply changing the arguments to the
options. Don’t assume that all users will know the full set of options
statically.

In general, options should be processed in order. If there is a conflict or if a non-cumulative option is passed multiple times, the last argument should win.

The parameter to the option function is generally unexported in this pattern, to restrict the options to being defined only within the package itself. This is a good default, though there may be times when it is appropriate to allow other packages to define options.

See Rob Pike’s original blog post and Dave Cheney’s talk for a more in-depth look at how these options can be used.

Some programs wish to present users with a rich command-line interface that
includes sub-commands. For example, `kubectl create`, `kubectl run`, and many
other sub-commands are all provided by the program `kubectl`. There are at least
the following libraries in common use for achieving this.

If you don’t have a preference or other considerations are equal, subcommands is recommended, since it is the simplest and is easy to use correctly. However, if you need different features that it doesn’t provide, pick one of the other options.

**Warning**: cobra command functions should use `cmd.Context()` to obtain a
context rather than creating their own root context with `context.Background`.
Code that uses the subcommands package already receives the correct context as a
function parameter.

You are not required to place each subcommand in a separate package, and it is often not necessary to do so. Apply the same considerations about package boundaries as in any Go codebase. If your code can be used both as a library and as a binary, it is usually beneficial to separate the CLI code and the library, making the CLI just one more of its clients. (This is not specific to CLIs that have subcommands, but is mentioned here because it is a common place where it comes up.)

`Test` functionGo distinguishes between “test helpers” and “assertion helpers”:

**Test helpers** are functions that do setup or cleanup tasks. All failures
that occur in test helpers are expected to be failures of the environment
(not from the code under test) — for example when a test database cannot be
started because there are no more free ports on this machine. For functions
like these, calling `t.Helper` is often appropriate to
mark them as a test helper. See error handling in test helpers for more
details.

**Assertion helpers** are functions that check the correctness of a system
and fail the test if an expectation is not met. Assertion helpers are
not considered idiomatic in Go.

The purpose of a test is to report pass/fail conditions of the code under test.
The ideal place to fail a test is within the `Test` function itself, as that
ensures that failure messages and the test logic are clear.

As your testing code grows, it may become necessary to factor out some
functionality to separate functions. Standard software engineering
considerations still apply, as *test code is still code*. If the functionality
does not interact with the testing framework, then all of the usual rules apply.
When the common code interacts with the framework, however, some care must be
taken to avoid common pitfalls that can lead to uninformative failure messages
and unmaintainable tests.

If many separate test cases require the same validation logic, arrange the test in one of the following ways instead of using assertion helpers or complex validation functions:

`Test`
function, even if it is repetitive. This works best in simple cases.`Test`.`error`) rather than taking a `testing.T` parameter and using it to fail the
test. Use logic within the `Test` to decide whether to fail, and to provide
useful test failures. You can also create test helpers to factor out
common boilerplate setup code.The design outlined in the last point maintains orthogonality. For example,
package `cmp` is not designed to fail tests, but rather to compare (and to
diff) values. It therefore does not need to know about the context in which the
comparison was made, since the caller can supply that. If your common testing
code provides a `cmp.Transformer` for your data type, that can often be the
simplest design. For other validations, consider returning an `error` value.

```
// Good:
// polygonCmp returns a cmp.Option that equates s2 geometry objects up to
// some small floating-point error.
func polygonCmp() cmp.Option {
 return cmp.Options{
 cmp.Transformer("polygon", func(p *s2.Polygon) []*s2.Loop { return p.Loops() }),
 cmp.Transformer("loop", func(l *s2.Loop) []s2.Point { return l.Vertices() }),
 cmpopts.EquateApprox(0.00000001, 0),
 cmpopts.EquateEmpty(),
 }
}
func TestFenceposts(t *testing.T) {
 // This is a test for a fictional function, Fenceposts, which draws a fence
 // around some Place object. The details are not important, except that
 // the result is some object that has s2 geometry (github.com/golang/geo/s2)
 got := Fencepost(tomsDiner, 1*meter)
 if diff := cmp.Diff(want, got, polygonCmp()); diff != "" {
 t.Errorf("Fencepost(tomsDiner, 1m) returned unexpected diff (-want+got):\n%v", diff)
 }
}
func FuzzFencepost(f *testing.F) {
 // Fuzz test (https://go.dev/doc/fuzz) for the same.
 f.Add(tomsDiner, 1*meter)
 f.Add(school, 3*meter)
 f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, geo Place, padding Length) {
 got := Fencepost(geo, padding)
 // Simple reference implementation: not used in prod, but easy to
 // reason about and therefore useful to check against in random tests.
 reference := slowFencepost(geo, padding)
 // In the fuzz test, inputs and outputs can be large so don't
 // bother with printing a diff. cmp.Equal is enough.
 if !cmp.Equal(got, reference, polygonCmp()) {
 t.Errorf("Fencepost returned wrong placement")
 }
 })
}
```
The `polygonCmp` function is agnostic about how it’s called; it doesn’t take a
concrete input type nor does it police what to do in case two objects don’t
match. Therefore, more callers can make use of it.

**Note:** There is an analogy between test helpers and plain library code. Code
in libraries should usually not panic except in rare circumstances; code
called from a test should not stop the test unless there is
no point in proceeding.

Most of the advice about testing in the style guide is about testing your own code. This section is about how to provide facilities for other people to test the code they write to ensure that it conforms to your library’s requirements.

Such testing is referred to as acceptance testing. The premise of this kind of testing is that the person using the test does not know every last detail of what goes on in the test; they just hand the inputs over to the testing facility to do the work. This can be thought of as a form of inversion of control.

In a typical Go test, the test function controls the program flow, and the no assert and test functions guidance encourages you to keep it that way. This section explains how to author support for these tests in a way that is consistent with Go style.

Before diving into how, consider an example from `io/fs`, excerpted below:

```
type FS interface {
 Open(name string) (File, error)
}
```
While there exist well-known implementations of `fs.FS`, a Go developer may be
expected to author one. To help validate the user-implemented `fs.FS` is
correct, a generic library has been provided in `testing/fstest` called
`fstest.TestFS`. This API treats the implementation as a blackbox to make sure
it upholds the most basic parts of the `io/fs` contract.

Now that we know what an acceptance test is and why you might use one, let’s
explore building an acceptance test for `package chess`, a package used to
simulate chess games. Users of `chess` are expected to implement the
`chess.Player` interface. These implementations are the primary thing we will
validate. Our acceptance test concerns itself with whether the player
implementation makes legal moves, not whether the moves are smart.

Create a new package for the validation behavior,
customarily named by appending the word
`test` to the package name (for example, `chesstest`).

Create the function that performs the validation by accepting the implementation under test as an argument and exercises it:

```
// ExercisePlayer tests a Player implementation in a single turn on a board.
// The board itself is spot checked for sensibility and correctness.
//
// It returns a nil error if the player makes a correct move in the context
// of the provided board. Otherwise ExercisePlayer returns one of this
// package's errors to indicate how and why the player failed the
// validation.
func ExercisePlayer(b *chess.Board, p chess.Player) error
```
The test should note which invariants are broken and how. Your design can choose between two disciplines for failure reporting:

**Fail fast**: return an error as soon as the implementation violates an
invariant.

This is the simplest approach, and it works well if the acceptance test is expected to execute quickly. Simple error sentinels and custom types can be used easily here, which conversely makes testing the acceptance test easy.

```
for color, army := range b.Armies {
 // The king should never leave the board, because the game ends at
 // checkmate.
 if army.King == nil {
 return &MissingPieceError{Color: color, Piece: chess.King}
 }
}
```
**Aggregate all failures**: collect all failures, and report them all.

This approach resembles the keep going guidance in feel and may be preferable if the acceptance test is expected to execute slowly.

How you aggregate the failures should be dictated by whether you want to give users the ability or yourself the ability to interrogate individual failures (for example, for you to test your acceptance test). Below demonstrates using a custom error type that aggregates errors:

```
var badMoves []error
move := p.Move()
if putsOwnKingIntoCheck(b, move) {
 badMoves = append(badMoves, PutsSelfIntoCheckError{Move: move})
}
if len(badMoves) > 0 {
 return SimulationError{BadMoves: badMoves}
}
return nil
```
The acceptance test should honor the keep going guidance
by not calling `t.Fatal` unless the test detects a broken invariant in the
system being exercised.

For example, `t.Fatal` should be reserved for exceptional cases such as
setup failure as usual:

```
func ExerciseGame(t *testing.T, cfg *Config, p chess.Player) error {
 t.Helper()
 if cfg.Simulation == Modem {
 conn, err := modempool.Allocate()
 if err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("No modem for the opponent could be provisioned: %v", err)
 }
 t.Cleanup(func() { modempool.Return(conn) })
 }
 // Run acceptance test (a whole game).
}
```
This technique can help you create concise, canonical validations. But do not attempt to use it to bypass the guidance on assertions.

The final product should be in a form similar to this for end users:

```
// Good:
package deepblue_test
import (
 "chesstest"
 "deepblue"
)
func TestAcceptance(t *testing.T) {
 player := deepblue.New()
 err := chesstest.ExerciseGame(t, chesstest.SimpleGame, player)
 if err != nil {
 t.Errorf("Deep Blue player failed acceptance test: %v", err)
 }
}
```
When testing component integrations, especially where HTTP or RPC are used as the underlying transport between the components, prefer using the real underlying transport to connect to the test version of the backend.

For example, suppose the code you want to test (sometimes referred to as “system under test” or SUT) interacts with a backend that implements the long running operations API. To test your SUT, use a real OperationsClient that is connected to a test double (e.g., a mock, stub, or fake) of the OperationsServer.

This is recommended over hand-implementing the client, due to the complexity of imitating client behavior correctly. By using the production client with a test-specific server, you ensure your test is using as much of the real code as possible.

**Tip:** Where possible, use a testing library provided by the authors of the
service under test.

`t.Error` vs. `t.Fatal`As discussed in decisions, tests should generally not abort at the first encountered problem.

However, some situations require that the test not proceed. Calling `t.Fatal` is
appropriate when some piece of test setup fails, especially in
test setup helpers, without which you cannot run the rest of the test. In a
table-driven test, `t.Fatal` is appropriate for failures that set up the whole
test function before the test loop. Failures that affect a single entry in the
test table, which make it impossible to continue with that entry, should be
reported as follows:

`t.Run` subtests, use `t.Error` followed by a `continue`
statement to move on to the next table entry.`t.Run`), use
`t.Fatal`, which ends the current subtest and allows your test case to
progress to the next subtest.**Warning:** It is not always safe to call `t.Fatal` and similar functions.
More details here.

**Note:** This section discusses test helpers in the sense Go uses the term:
functions that perform test setup and cleanup, not common assertion facilities.
See the test functions section for more discussion.

Operations performed by a test helper sometimes fail. For example, setting up a
directory with files involves I/O, which can fail. When test helpers fail, their
failure often signifies that the test cannot continue, since a setup
precondition failed. When this happens, prefer calling one of the `Fatal`
functions in the helper:

```
// Good:
func mustAddGameAssets(t *testing.T, dir string) {
 t.Helper()
 if err := os.WriteFile(path.Join(dir, "pak0.pak"), pak0, 0644); err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("Setup failed: could not write pak0 asset: %v", err)
 }
 if err := os.WriteFile(path.Join(dir, "pak1.pak"), pak1, 0644); err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("Setup failed: could not write pak1 asset: %v", err)
 }
}
```
This keeps the calling side cleaner than if the helper were to return the error to the test itself:

```
// Bad:
func addGameAssets(t *testing.T, dir string) error {
 t.Helper()
 if err := os.WriteFile(path.Join(d, "pak0.pak"), pak0, 0644); err != nil {
 return err
 }
 if err := os.WriteFile(path.Join(d, "pak1.pak"), pak1, 0644); err != nil {
 return err
 }
 return nil
}
```
**Warning:** It is not always safe to call `t.Fatal` and similar functions.
More details here.

The failure message should include a description of what happened. This is important, as you may be providing a testing API to many users, especially as the number of error-producing steps in the helper increases. When the test fails, the user should know where, and why.

**Tip:** Go 1.14 introduced a `t.Cleanup` function that can be used to
register cleanup functions that run when your test completes. The function also
works with test helpers. See
GoTip #4: Cleaning Up Your Tests
for guidance on simplifying test helpers.

The snippet below in a fictional file called `paint_test.go` demonstrates how
`(*testing.T).Helper` influences failure reporting in a Go test:

```
package paint_test
import (
 "fmt"
 "testing"
)
func paint(color string) error {
 return fmt.Errorf("no %q paint today", color)
}
func badSetup(t *testing.T) {
 // This should call t.Helper, but doesn't.
 if err := paint("taupe"); err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("Could not paint the house under test: %v", err) // line 15
 }
}
func goodSetup(t *testing.T) {
 t.Helper()
 if err := paint("lilac"); err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("Could not paint the house under test: %v", err)
 }
}
func TestBad(t *testing.T) {
 badSetup(t)
 // ...
}
func TestGood(t *testing.T) {
 goodSetup(t) // line 32
 // ...
}
```
Here is an example of this output when run. Note the highlighted text and how it differs:

```
=== RUN TestBad
 paint_test.go:15: Could not paint the house under test: no "taupe" paint today
--- FAIL: TestBad (0.00s)
=== RUN TestGood
 paint_test.go:32: Could not paint the house under test: no "lilac" paint today
--- FAIL: TestGood (0.00s)
FAIL
```
The error with `paint_test.go:15` refers to the line of the setup function that
failed in `badSetup`:

`t.Fatalf("Could not paint the house under test: %v", err)`

Whereas `paint_test.go:32` refers to the line of the test that failed in
`TestGood`:

`goodSetup(t)`

Correctly using `(*testing.T).Helper` attributes the location of the failure
much better when:

**Tip:** If a helper calls `(*testing.T).Error` or `(*testing.T).Fatal`, provide
some context in the format string to help determine what went wrong and why.

**Tip:** If nothing a helper does can cause a test to fail, it doesn’t need to
call `t.Helper`. Simplify its signature by removing `t` from the function
parameter list.

`t.Fatal` from separate goroutinesAs documented in package testing, it is
incorrect to call `t.FailNow`, `t.Fatal`, etc. from any goroutine but the one
running the Test function (or the subtest). If your test starts new goroutines,
they must not call these functions from inside these goroutines.

Test helpers usually don’t signal failure from new
goroutines, and therefore it is all right for them to use `t.Fatal`. If in
doubt, call `t.Error` and return instead.

```
// Good:
func TestRevEngine(t *testing.T) {
 engine, err := Start()
 if err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("Engine failed to start: %v", err)
 }
 num := 11
 var wg sync.WaitGroup
 wg.Add(num)
 for i := 0; i < num; i++ {
 go func() {
 defer wg.Done()
 if err := engine.Vroom(); err != nil {
 // This cannot be t.Fatalf.
 t.Errorf("No vroom left on engine: %v", err)
 return
 }
 if rpm := engine.Tachometer(); rpm > 1e6 {
 t.Errorf("Inconceivable engine rate: %d", rpm)
 }
 }()
 }
 wg.Wait()
 if seen := engine.NumVrooms(); seen != num {
 t.Errorf("engine.NumVrooms() = %d, want %d", seen, num)
 }
}
```
Adding `t.Parallel` to a test or subtest does not make it unsafe to call
`t.Fatal`.

When all calls to the `testing` API are in the test function,
it is usually easy to spot incorrect usage because the `go` keyword is plain to
see. Passing `testing.T` arguments around makes tracking such usage harder.
Typically, the reason for passing these arguments is to introduce a test helper,
and those should not depend on the system under test. Therefore, if a test
helper registers a fatal test failure, it can and
should do so from the test’s goroutine.

In table-driven tests, prefer to specify field names when initializing test case struct literals. This is helpful when the test cases cover a large amount of vertical space (e.g. more than 20-30 lines), when there are adjacent fields with the same type, and also when you wish to omit fields which have the zero value. For example:

```
// Good:
func TestStrJoin(t *testing.T) {
 tests := []struct {
 slice []string
 separator string
 skipEmpty bool
 want string
 }{
 {
 slice: []string{"a", "b", ""},
 separator: ",",
 want: "a,b,",
 },
 {
 slice: []string{"a", "b", ""},
 separator: ",",
 skipEmpty: true,
 want: "a,b",
 },
 // ...
 }
 // ...
}
```
Where possible, setup of resources and dependencies should be as closely scoped to specific test cases as possible. For example, given a setup function:

```
// mustLoadDataSet loads a data set for the tests.
//
// This example is very simple and easy to read. Often realistic setup is more
// complex, error-prone, and potentially slow.
func mustLoadDataset(t *testing.T) []byte {
 t.Helper()
 data, err := os.ReadFile("path/to/your/project/testdata/dataset")
 if err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("Could not load dataset: %v", err)
 }
 return data
}
```
Call `mustLoadDataset` explicitly in test functions that need it:

```
// Good:
func TestParseData(t *testing.T) {
 data := mustLoadDataset(t)
 parsed, err := ParseData(data)
 if err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("Unexpected error parsing data: %v", err)
 }
 want := &DataTable{ /* ... */ }
 if got := parsed; !cmp.Equal(got, want) {
 t.Errorf("ParseData(data) = %v, want %v", got, want)
 }
}
func TestListContents(t *testing.T) {
 data := mustLoadDataset(t)
 contents, err := ListContents(data)
 if err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("Unexpected error listing contents: %v", err)
 }
 want := []string{ /* ... */ }
 if got := contents; !cmp.Equal(got, want) {
 t.Errorf("ListContents(data) = %v, want %v", got, want)
 }
}
func TestRegression682831(t *testing.T) {
 if got, want := guessOS("zpc79.example.com"), "grhat"; got != want {
 t.Errorf(`guessOS("zpc79.example.com") = %q, want %q`, got, want)
 }
}
```
The test function `TestRegression682831` does not use the data set and therefore
does not call `mustLoadDataset`, which could be slow and failure-prone:

```
// Bad:
var dataset []byte
func TestParseData(t *testing.T) {
 // As documented above without calling mustLoadDataset directly.
}
func TestListContents(t *testing.T) {
 // As documented above without calling mustLoadDataset directly.
}
func TestRegression682831(t *testing.T) {
 if got, want := guessOS("zpc79.example.com"), "grhat"; got != want {
 t.Errorf(`guessOS("zpc79.example.com") = %q, want %q`, got, want)
 }
}
func init() {
 dataset = mustLoadDataset()
}
```
A user may wish to run a function in isolation of the others and should not be penalized by these factors:

```
# No reason for this to perform the expensive initialization.
$ go test -run TestRegression682831
```
`TestMain` entrypointIf **all tests in the package** require common setup and the **setup requires
teardown**, you can use a custom testmain entrypoint. This can happen if the
resource the test cases require is especially expensive to setup, and the cost
should be amortized. Typically you have extracted any unrelated tests from the
test suite at that point. It is typically only used for functional tests.

Using a custom `TestMain` **should not be your first choice** due the amount of
care that should be taken for correct use. Consider first whether the solution
in the *amortizing common test setup* section or an ordinary test helper is
sufficient for your needs.

```
// Good:
var db *sql.DB
func TestInsert(t *testing.T) { /* omitted */ }
func TestSelect(t *testing.T) { /* omitted */ }
func TestUpdate(t *testing.T) { /* omitted */ }
func TestDelete(t *testing.T) { /* omitted */ }
// runMain sets up the test dependencies and eventually executes the tests.
// It is defined as a separate function to enable the setup stages to clearly
// defer their teardown steps.
func runMain(ctx context.Context, m *testing.M) (code int, err error) {
 ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
 defer cancel()
 d, err := setupDatabase(ctx)
 if err != nil {
 return 0, err
 }
 defer d.Close() // Expressly clean up database.
 db = d // db is defined as a package-level variable.
 // m.Run() executes the regular, user-defined test functions.
 // Any defer statements that have been made will be run after m.Run()
 // completes.
 return m.Run(), nil
}
func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
 code, err := runMain(context.Background(), m)
 if err != nil {
 // Failure messages should be written to STDERR, which log.Fatal uses.
 log.Fatal(err)
 }
 // NOTE: defer statements do not run past here due to os.Exit
 // terminating the process.
 os.Exit(code)
}
```
Ideally a test case is hermetic between invocations of itself and between other test cases.

At the very least, ensure that individual test cases reset any global state they have modified if they have done so (for instance, if the tests are working with an external database).

Using a `sync.Once` may be appropriate, though not required, if all of the
following are true about the common setup:

```
// Good:
var dataset struct {
 once sync.Once
 data []byte
 err error
}
func mustLoadDataset(t *testing.T) []byte {
 t.Helper()
 dataset.once.Do(func() {
 data, err := os.ReadFile("path/to/your/project/testdata/dataset")
 // dataset is defined as a package-level variable.
 dataset.data = data
 dataset.err = err
 })
 if err := dataset.err; err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("Could not load dataset: %v", err)
 }
 return dataset.data
}
```
When `mustLoadDataset` is used in multiple test functions, its cost is
amortized:

```
// Good:
func TestParseData(t *testing.T) {
 data := mustLoadDataset(t)
 // As documented above.
}
func TestListContents(t *testing.T) {
 data := mustLoadDataset(t)
 // As documented above.
}
func TestRegression682831(t *testing.T) {
 if got, want := guessOS("zpc79.example.com"), "grhat"; got != want {
 t.Errorf(`guessOS("zpc79.example.com") = %q, want %q`, got, want)
 }
}
```
The reason that common teardown is tricky is there is no uniform place to
register cleanup routines. If the setup function (in this case
`mustLoadDataset`) relies on a context, `sync.Once` may be problematic. This is
because the second of two racing calls to the setup function would need to wait
for the first call to finish before returning. This period of waiting cannot be
easily made to respect the context’s cancellation.

There are several ways to concatenate strings in Go. Some examples include:

`fmt.Sprintf``strings.Builder``text/template``safehtml/template`Though there is no one-size-fits-all rule for which to choose, the following guidance outlines when each method is preferred.

Prefer using “+” when concatenating few strings. This method is syntactically the simplest and requires no import.

```
// Good:
key := "projectid: " + p
```
`fmt.Sprintf` when formattingPrefer using `fmt.Sprintf` when building a complex string with formatting. Using
many “+” operators may obscure the end result.

```
// Good:
str := fmt.Sprintf("%s [%s:%d]-> %s", src, qos, mtu, dst)
```
```
// Bad:
bad := src.String() + " [" + qos.String() + ":" + strconv.Itoa(mtu) + "]-> " + dst.String()
```
**Best Practice:** When the output of the string-building operation is an
`io.Writer`, don’t construct a temporary string with `fmt.Sprintf` just to send
it to the Writer. Instead, use `fmt.Fprintf` to emit to the Writer directly.

When the formatting is even more complex, prefer `text/template` or
`safehtml/template` as appropriate.

`strings.Builder` for constructing a string piecemealPrefer using `strings.Builder` when building a string bit-by-bit.
`strings.Builder` takes amortized linear time, whereas “+” and `fmt.Sprintf`
take quadratic time when called sequentially to form a larger string.

```
// Good:
b := new(strings.Builder)
for i, d := range digitsOfPi {
 fmt.Fprintf(b, "the %d digit of pi is: %d\n", i, d)
}
str := b.String()
```
**Note:** For more discussion, see
GoTip #29: Building Strings Efficiently.

Prefer to use backticks (`) when constructing constant, multi-line string literals.

```
// Good:
usage := `Usage:
custom_tool [args]`
```
```
// Bad:
usage := "" +
 "Usage:\n" +
 "\n" +
 "custom_tool [args]"
```
Libraries should not force their clients to use APIs that rely on global state. They are advised not to expose APIs or export package level variables that control behavior for all clients as parts of their API. The rest of the section uses “global” and “package level state” synonymously.

Instead, if your functionality maintains state, allow your clients to create and use instance values.

**Important:** While this guidance is applicable to all developers, it is most
critical for infrastructure providers who offer libraries, integrations, and
services to other teams.

```
// Good:
// Package sidecar manages subprocesses that provide features for applications.
package sidecar
type Registry struct { plugins map[string]*Plugin }
func New() *Registry { return &Registry{plugins: make(map[string]*Plugin)} }
func (r *Registry) Register(name string, p *Plugin) error { ... }
```
Your users will instantiate the data they need (a `*sidecar.Registry`) and then
pass it as an explicit dependency:

```
// Good:
package main
func main() {
 sidecars := sidecar.New()
 if err := sidecars.Register("Cloud Logger", cloudlogger.New()); err != nil {
 log.Exitf("Could not setup cloud logger: %v", err)
 }
 cfg := &myapp.Config{Sidecars: sidecars}
 myapp.Run(context.Background(), cfg)
}
```
There are different approaches to migrating existing code to support dependency passing. The main one you will use is passing dependencies as parameters to constructors, functions, methods, or struct fields on the call chain.

APIs that do not support explicit dependency passing become fragile as the number of clients increases:

```
// Bad:
package sidecar
var registry = make(map[string]*Plugin)
func Register(name string, p *Plugin) error { /* registers plugin in registry */ }
```
Consider what happens in the case of tests exercising code that transitively relies on a sidecar for cloud logging.

```
// Bad:
package app
import (
 "cloudlogger"
 "sidecar"
 "testing"
)
func TestEndToEnd(t *testing.T) {
 // The system under test (SUT) relies on a sidecar for a production cloud
 // logger already being registered.
 ... // Exercise SUT and check invariants.
}
func TestRegression_NetworkUnavailability(t *testing.T) {
 // We had an outage because of a network partition that rendered the cloud
 // logger inoperative, so we added a regression test to exercise the SUT with
 // a test double that simulates network unavailability with the logger.
 sidecar.Register("cloudlogger", cloudloggertest.UnavailableLogger)
 ... // Exercise SUT and check invariants.
}
func TestRegression_InvalidUser(t *testing.T) {
 // The system under test (SUT) relies on a sidecar for a production cloud
 // logger already being registered.
 //
 // Oops. cloudloggertest.UnavailableLogger is still registered from the
 // previous test.
 ... // Exercise SUT and check invariants.
}
```
Go tests are executed sequentially by default, so the tests above run as:

`TestEndToEnd``TestRegression_NetworkUnavailability`, which overrides the default value of
cloudlogger`TestRegression_InvalidUser`, which requires the default value of
cloudlogger registered in `package sidecar`This creates an order-dependent test case, which breaks running with test filters, and prevents tests from running in parallel or being sharded.

Using global state poses problems that lack easy answers for you and the API’s clients:

What happens if a client needs to use different and separately operating
sets of `Plugin`s (for example, to support multiple servers) in the same
process space?

What happens if a client wants to replace a registered `Plugin` with an
alternative implementation in a test, like a test double?

What happens if a client’s tests require hermeticity between instances of a
`Plugin`, or between all of the plugins registered?

What happens if multiple clients `Register` a `Plugin` under the same name?
Which one wins, if any?

How should errors be handled? If the code panics
or calls `log.Fatal`, will that always be
appropriate for all places in which API would be called?
Can a client verify it doesn’t do something bad before doing so?

Are there certain stages in a program’s startup phases or lifetime during
which `Register` can be called and when it can’t?

What happens if `Register` is called at the wrong time? A client could call
`Register` in `func init`,
before flags are parsed, or after `main`. The stage at which a function is
called affects error handling. If the author of an API assumes the API is
*only* called during program initialization without the requirement that it
is, the assumption may nudge the author to design error handling to
abort the program by modeling the API as a
`Must`-like function. Aborting is not appropriate for general-purpose
library functions that can be used at any stage.

What if the client’s and the designer’s concurrency needs are mismatched?

Global state has cascading effects on the
health of the Google codebase. Global state should
be approached with **extreme scrutiny**.

Global state comes in several forms, and you can use a few litmus tests to identify when it is safe.

Several of the most common problematic API forms are enumerated below:

Top-level variables irrespective of whether they are exported.

```
// Bad:
package logger
// Sinks manages the default output sources for this package's logging API. This
// variable should be set at package initialization time and never thereafter.
var Sinks []Sink
```
See the litmus tests to know when these are safe.

The service locator pattern. See the first example. The service locator pattern itself is not problematic, rather the locator being defined as global.

Registries for callbacks and similar behaviors.

```
// Bad:
package health
var unhealthyFuncs []func
func OnUnhealthy(f func()) {
 unhealthyFuncs = append(unhealthyFuncs, f)
}
```
Thick-Client singletons for things like backends, storage, data access layers, and other system resources. These often pose additional problems with service reliability.

```
// Bad:
package useradmin
var client pb.UserAdminServiceClientInterface
func Client() *pb.UserAdminServiceClient {
 if client == nil {
 client = ... // Set up client.
 }
 return client
}
```

Note:Many legacy APIs in the Google codebase do not follow this guidance; in fact, some Go standard libraries allow for configuration via global values. Nevertheless, the legacy API’s contravention of this guidanceshould not be used as precedentfor continuing the pattern.It is better to invest in proper API design today than pay for redesigning later.

APIs using the patterns above are unsafe when:

`func init`, whether flags are parsed yet, etc.Provided the conditions above are avoided, there are a **few limited
circumstances under which these APIs are safe**, namely when any of the
following is true:

Note:Sidecar processes maynotstrictly be process-local. They can and often are shared with more than one application process. Moreover, these sidecars often interact with external distributed systems.Further, the same stateless, idempotent, and local rules in addition to the base considerations above would apply to the code of the sidecar process itself!

An example of one of these safe situations is
`package image` with its
`image.RegisterFormat` function.
Consider the litmus tests from above applied to a typical decoder, like the one
for handling the PNG format:

`package image`’s APIs that use the registered decoders
(for example, `image.Decode`) cannot interfere with one another, similarly
for tests. The only exception is `image.RegisterFormat`, but that is
mitigated by the points below.While not recommended, it is acceptable to provide a simplified API that uses package level state if you need to maximize convenience for the user.

Follow the litmus tests with these guidelines in such cases:

`http.Handle` internally calling
`(*http.ServeMux).Handle` on
the package variable
`http.DefaultServeMux`.This package-level API must only be used by binary build targets, not libraries, unless the libraries are undertaking a refactoring to support dependency passing. Infrastructure libraries that can be imported by other packages must not rely on package-level state of the packages they import.

For example, an infrastructure provider implementing a sidecar that is to be shared with other teams using the API from the top should offer an API to accommodate this:

```
// Good:
package cloudlogger
func New() *Logger { ... }
func Register(r *sidecar.Registry, l *Logger) {
 r.Register("Cloud Logging", l)
}
```

Interfaces in Go are powerful but can be overused or misunderstood. Because Go interfaces are satisfied implicitly, they are a structural tool rather than a declarative one. The following guidance provides the best practices for how to design and return interfaces in Go without over-engineering your codebase.

Refer to Decisions’ section on interfaces for a summary.

The most common mistake is creating an interface before a real need exists.

**Don’t confuse the concept with the keyword:** Just because you are
designing a “service” or a “repository” or similar pattern doesn’t mean you
need a named interface type (e.g., `type Service interface`). Focus on the
behavior and its concrete implementation first.

**Reuse existing interfaces:** If an interface already exists, especially in
generated code, like a RPC client or server, use it (testing RPC). Do not
wrap a generated RPC code in a new, manual interface just for the sake of
abstraction or testing. Use real transports instead.

**Don’t define back doors only for tests:** Do not export a test double
implementation of an interface from an API that consumes it. Instead, prefer
to design the API so that it can be tested using the public API of the
real implementation.

Every exported type increases the cognitive load for the reader. When you export a test double alongside the real implementation, you force the reader to understand three entities (the interface, the real implementation, and the test double) instead of one.

Export an interface for a test double when you have a material need to support substitution.

When it does make sense to create an interface:

**Multiple implementations:** When there are two or more concrete types that
must be handled by the same logic (e.g., something that operates with both
json.Encoder and
gob.GobEncoder), the API
consumer could define an interface.

**Decoupling packages:** To break circular dependencies between two packages
(see an example), an API producer could
define an interface.

**Caution:** Carefully observe guidance on Package Size.
Introducing interfaces to break dependency cycles is often a signal of
improperly structured packages.

**Hiding complexity:** When a concrete type has a massive API surface, but a
specific function only needs one or two methods, an API consumer may define
an interface.

**Do not export interface types unnecessarily:** If an interface is only
used internally within a package to satisfy a specific logic flow, keep the
interface unexported. Exporting an interface commits you to maintaining that
API for external callers.

**The consumer defines the interface:** In Go, interfaces generally belong
in the package that uses them, not the package that implements them. The
consumer should define only the methods they actually use
GoTip #78: Minimal Viable Interfaces, adhering to the idea that
the bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction.

There are common scenarios where it often makes sense for the producer (the package providing the logic) to export the interface:

**The interface is the product:** When a package’s primary purpose is to
provide a common protocol that many different implementations must
follow, the producer defines the interface. For example,
io.Writer,
hash.Hash. The concept of “protocol”
includes aspects like documentation about critical
behaviors (e.g., expected use case, edge cases, concurrency) that need
to be centrally and canonically explicated. Another prominent example of
this is generated interfaces from protobuf. It doesn’t abstract a
specific behavior, it defines a boundary. Its purpose is to ensure that
your server implementation exactly matches the schema defined in the
`.proto` file. Here, the interface serves as a rigid legal contract
between the service and its clients.

For large systems, if the interface lives inside a huge implementation package, every client is forced to import the entire world just to reference the interface. You may define the interface in a standalone, implementation-free package, avoiding unnecessary symbols and potential circular dependencies. This is also the same philosophy used by generated code from protobuf.

**Prevent interface bloat:** In large codebases, maintenance becomes
difficult if numerous packages utilize the same `AuthService` while each
defining an identical `type Authorizer interface`. While Go often favors
a little copying over a little dependency,
keep in mind that maintaining perfectly mirrored interfaces (see point
above) across many packages can create an unnecessary burden.

**Resolve circular dependency:** see
an example below.

**Keep interfaces small:** The larger the interface,
the harder it is to implement and to write code that takes advantage of it.
Small interfaces are easier to compose into larger ones if needed.

**Documentation:** Treat every interface as the “user manual” for your
abstraction. The depth of your documentation should be proportional to the
interface’s cognitive load, not just the count of its methods. Whether an
interface has ten methods or a single `Write` of
io.Writer, if a programmer is expected to
interact with that type, the API must be documented thoroughly.

**Accept interfaces, return concrete types:** Returning a concrete type
allows the caller to use the full functionality of the value without being
locked into a specific interface abstraction
GoTip #49: Accept Interfaces, Return Concrete Types.

There are several common scenarios where returning an interface is the idiomatic choice:

**Encapsulation:** While interfaces cannot strictly hide exported methods
(as they remain accessible via type assertions), returning an interface is a
powerful tool for limiting the default API surface and guiding the caller’s
behavior.. The most common example is the `error` interface; you
almost never return a concrete error type like
`*MyCustomError`.

Consider a `ThrottledReader` that implements `io.Reader` but also has a
`Refill` method for internal bucket management. Returning the concrete
`*ThrottledReader` invites the caller to manage the bucket manually, which
could lead to race conditions or broken rate-limiting logic. By returning an
interface, you tell the caller that your only job is to consume this reader.
If you try to cast this back to a `ThrottledReader` to `Refill` the internal
bucket, you are breaking the contract.

```
// Good:
type ThrottledReader struct {
 source io.Reader
 limit int // bytes per second
 balance int // current allowance of bytes
 lastRefill time.Time
}
// Read implements the io.Reader interface with rate-limiting logic.
func (t *ThrottledReader) Read(p []byte) (int, error) { ... }
// Refill manually adds tokens to the bucket.
// INTERNAL USE ONLY: Calling this from outside breaks the rate limit logic.
func (t *ThrottledReader) Refill(amount int) {
 t.balance = min(t.balance + amount, t.limit)
}
// New returns the io.Reader with rate-limiting.
func New(r io.Reader, bytesPerSec int) io.Reader {
 return &ThrottledReader{
 source: r,
 limit: bytesPerSec,
 balance: bytesPerSec, // start with a full bucket
 lastRefill: time.Now(),
 }
}
```
This raises a natural question: if `Refill` is dangerous, why export it at
all? In complex systems, you often need internal orchestration. For example,
an `AggregateReader` manages multiple `ThrottledReader` values to ensure
total bandwidth across all streams stays under a global limit. This
coordinator needs to call Refill to distribute tokens, but the non-power
user processing the data should never see that capability.

**Caution:** Before returning an interface to hide implementation, ask:
“Would a user calling these extra methods actually break the system’s
integrity or meaningfully limit maintainability?” If the extra details allow
the user to bypass safety checks, or if exposing the concrete type makes it
impossible to change the underlying provider later without a breaking
change, you may return an interface. Do not rotely encapsulate without
reason.

**Certain patterns:** If a function is designed to return one of several
different concrete types based on decisions made at runtime, it must return
an interface. This is commonly true with command, chaining, factory, and
strategy patterns.
Consider this code that selects which encoder to use based the requested
format:

```
// Good:
func NewWriter(format string) io.Writer {
 switch format {
 case "json":
 return &jsonWriter{}
 case "xml":
 return &xmlWriter{}
 default:
 return &textWriter{}
 }
}
```
The following example of a chaining API demonstrates how returning an
interface enables polymorphic behavior. By allowing callers to use either
`client.Do(req)` or `client.WithAuth("token").Do(req)`, you can swap
implementations without breaking the calling code.

```
// Good:
type Client interface {
 WithAuth(token string) Client
 Do(req *Request) error
}
```
These patterns are guidelines, not rules. Avoid forcing an interface if a
single, robust concrete type can handle the abstraction internally. For
example, the standard database/sql
library exports a single concrete `DB` type instead of forcing an interface
to handle types like `MySQLDB` and `OracleDB`.

**Avoiding circular
dependencies:** If returning a concrete type would require importing
a package that already imports your current package, you must return an
interface to break the circular dependency.

For example:

```
// Bad:
package app
import "myproject/plugin"
type Config struct {
 APIKey string
}
func Start() {
 p := plugin.New()
}
```
```
// Bad:
package plugin
import "myproject/app" // ERROR: Import cycle!
func New() *app.Config {
 return &app.Config{APIKey: "secret"}
}
```
In this case, `plugin`’s `New` cannot return `*app.Config` because it would
create a circular import. To break this, we use the fact that interfaces are
satisfied implicitly. We move the “contract” to a neutral place or have the
producer return an interface that the consumer already understands.

If `plugin`’s `New` returns an interface instead of the concrete
`*app.Config` struct, it no longer needs to import package `app`.

```
package plugin
type Configurer interface {
 APIKey() string
}
type localConfig struct {
 key string
}
func (c localConfig) APIKey() string { return c.key }
// New returns the interface Configurer instead of the concrete app.Config
func New() Configurer {
 return &localConfig{key: "secret"}
}
```
```
package app
import "myproject/plugin"
func Start() {
 conf := plugin.New() // 'conf' is now a Configurer interface
 fmt.Println(conf.APIKey())
}
```
**Caution:** Carefully observe guidance on Package Size.
Introducing interfaces to break dependency cycles is often a signal of
improperly structured packages. Consolidated packages are often preferred
over too many too small packages that fail to stand on their own.
